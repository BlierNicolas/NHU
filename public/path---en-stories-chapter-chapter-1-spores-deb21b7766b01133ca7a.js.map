I smile and start to go around my plants and write down my observations from what I saw yesterday. I love watching and looking after plants. My dad says it's becoming an obsession and that at my age, I should be interested in boys. They interest me, but not as much as plants, that's all. </p>\\n<p>I approach one of my plants that I consider a hybrid because of its property to grow in the greenhouse when the humidity is not at all appropriate for this type of plant. I notice that the bulbs of the plant have grown in one day; it should release its spores soon. I approach a little my hand of one of the leaves to observe the color. A kind of dull noise resounds and the bulbs are suddenly placed in front of my face. I move back as fast as I can and see the bulbs releasing their spores. With one hand, I try to change their trajectories so they don't reach my face.</p>\\n<p>The next moment the spores land on the ground; I avoided them. I find that very strange. Normally, I'd get them in my face. I observe the plant with a little more distance and approach a flower a little further away. I sense some kind of connection. I reach out my hand to a flower and make it bloom. I look at my hand and close my eyes. I can see all the plants around me and I feel that one of the plants I watered earlier still needs water. I'll give him some with a smile on my face. I'll finish my checks and go home. </p>\\n<p>My mother had finished making dinner. So I help her set the table and serve the portions.</p>\\n<p>My mom: How was your day, sweetie?<br>\\nGaia: Long and boring, like most school days.<br>\\nMy mother: You will see when you have discovered the professional branch that will please you. Time will seem to fly by.<br>\\nGaïa: I love botany, but there are no classes here.</p>\\n<p>My mother smiled at me, she was hiding something.</p>\\n<p>Gaia: What mom? What's the matter.<br>\\nMy mother: We'll talk about it over dinner.<br>\\nGaia: Oh? Okay.</p>\\n<p>We finish serving the portions.</p>\\n<p>Gaia: Dad! Come and eat!</p>\\n<p>My father finally arrives and sits in the same place as usual. In fact, we all sit in our usual places, like most families who eat together for dinner.</p>\\n<p>Gaïa: So Dad, how was your day?<br>\\nMy father: Clients who don't know what they want and waste my time. At least some people know what they're looking for.<br>\\nMy mom: Roh honey, you could be more positive.<br>\\nFather: There's a difference between positivism and realism, darling.</p>\\n<p>I smile a little, I think my father is funny when he says that kind of thing. I see my father looking at me and winking at me. My mother smiles softly, she is always a little disoriented when my father makes these remarks. We keep eating and my dad looks at my mom.</p>\\n<p>Father: How was your day, darling?<br>\\nMy mother: Very well, my boss was away today so I was able to move forward with the projects I didn't have time to finalize yesterday.<br>\\nMy father: You see, you too are realistic in what you say.<br>\\nMy mother: Oh, darling, would you like us to tell her what we have planned?<br>\\nFather: Yes, you can go.<br>\\nMy mom: We saved up so you could go to campus in the next town.<br>\\nGaïa: Really?</p>\\n<p>I smile, my parents didn't do this seriously?</p>\\n<p>My mother: Yes, you will be able to study botany as you have dreamed for years.<br>\\nGaïa: You are the best parents in the world!</p>\\n<p>I get up and go kiss my parents. My mother smiles at me and my father too, they seem happy with my reaction. After dinner, I do the dishes while my mother sits in the living room to watch her shows. My father, on the other hand, goes into his office and lingers on his business in order to sell cars. As for me, I go back to my room and approach my favorite flower. I give her the amount of water she needs and smile as she moves gently under the water that waters her. I am amazed to see such a phenomenon.</p>\\n<p>Suddenly, I feel the flower communicating with me. I feel she wants me to add nutrients to her soil pot. A few seconds later, I see that I can see the energy flowing through the plant's fibers. I'm getting a little worried, how come I'm aware of these things? I close and open my eyes to see if it's my imagination playing tricks on me. No, the energy fibers are still there. I get out of my room and head for my greenhouse. On the way, the same phenomenon is reproduced on the plant of the corridor then the grass when I go out in the yard. I enter my greenhouse and experience the same thing. A thousand and one plants that emanate from energy. I take out my cell phone and take several pictures. I look at them, they're normal. It's really me who sees plants like that.</p>\\n<p>After a while, I don't know what to do. I would like to see normally, it becomes exhausting to see all its energy fibers. A little later, my eyes finally start to see normally again. I go back to my room and sit on my bed. I sigh softly. What's going on with me? How do I do that? After a few minutes, I get up, grab my pajamas and go shower before going to bed. The night brings advice as my mother often tells me.</p>\"}},\"chapitreAvant\":null,\"chapitreApres\":\"chapter-2-disruptions-in-class\",\"nomRoman\":\"power-of-nature\",\"slug\":\"chapter-1-spores\",\"codeChapitre\":\"H0006C001\",\"equivalentUrl\":\"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-1-spores\"}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"chapter-1-spores\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---en-stories-chapter-chapter-1-spores-deb21b7766b01133ca7a.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"contentfulChapitre\":{\"titreChapitre\":\"Chapter 1 - Spores\",\"texte\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I get home from school and automatically throw my bag in the same place as usual.
