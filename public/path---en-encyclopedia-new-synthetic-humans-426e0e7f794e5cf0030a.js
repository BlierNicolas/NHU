It is possible that the powers take time to manifest themselves or that the body rejects the serum in question, causing discomfort and some physical suffering. But if the serum works properly after one or more doses, the powers remain permanently present. However, the gene will not be transmitted by reproduction.</p>\n<p>Darakei Drumel is the individual who created this serum for research purposes. Julius Anderson is the man responsible for the theft of the serum and the activation of powers on a dozen former military personnel.
