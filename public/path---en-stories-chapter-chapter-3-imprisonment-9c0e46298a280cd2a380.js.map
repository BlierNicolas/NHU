She asks me how I am, what I do, what she has to say to my friends who keep asking her for news. I answer the classic thing. I'm in rehab camp for my back problems. She also knows that I no longer have any back problems, but I have to stay at GenCorp until I can retract my wings. I'm also learning to defend myself at GenCorp, something that seemed a little strange to me, but good.</p>\\n<p>One day, I realize something. I could never go out with the wings I have, everyone will stare at me and call me a monster. Even if the people of my kind, the New Humans, are known, I couldn't go unnoticed.</p>\\n<p>Today, I had to go practice flying. I had some difficulty keeping the balance, but nothing insurmountable. So a guard comes to open my room door. I go out and salute with my hand. He keeps his serious mixed with some kind of disgust. I sigh internally, I don't like that guard. Sophia's nicer than Bryan. So we go to the training room. I remove my arnet which has been specially designed for my wings and keep them folded. Darakei was there, with a pad to take notes. He seemed a little lost in thought.</p>\\n<p>Sam: Are you all right, Mr. Drumel?<br>\\nDarakei: Hm? Yes! Sorry, Sam. I was thinking about something else.<br>\\nSam: It's okay, I'm motivated for today! I feel like I'm gonna make it.<br>\\nDarakei: I like that attitude.</p>\\n<p>He smiles at me and I'm going to get on the starting board. I'll take my place. To begin, I take a good breath and give a powerful blow to the ground. I know I have to give three more shots to reach the first ring, or even four if I want to dive. I give the four strokes of wings and place my wings very right to glide towards the first ring. The second ring is a little lower, I'll have to place myself at a thirty degree angle down. I pass the first ring and head for the second. The third is about 5 kicks higher and quite far from the second. That leaves me plenty of room to climb back up.</p>\\n<p>I manage to make it to the seventh ring out of the ten and I have to land. I'm exhausted. Darakei approaches, smiling to his ears.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: Congratulations Sam, you broke your record!<br>\\nSam: Thanks Darakei, but my record was one before...<br>\\nDarakei: It's still a record broken after all.<br>\\nSam: Thank you.</p>\\n<p>Darakei's phone rings, he looks at it quickly.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: Excuse me.</p>\\n<p>Darakei answers, asks to wait a moment and goes further before starting to speak. I stand there looking at him and having fun folding and unfolding my wings.</p>\\n<p>After a few minutes he seems to be between submission and disgust. The person who just called him must have been important enough to put him in this state.</p>\\n<p>Darakei came back to me, pissed and disgusted.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: You're gonna have to go back to your room, Sam.<br>\\nSam: What?! What do you mean?<br>\\nDarakei: I have orders and you are no longer allowed to go out or communicate with the outside world...<br>\\nSam: What?! This is bullshit!<br>\\nDarakei: Sam, please don't make this harder than it should be...<br>\\nSam: I wouldn't get kidnapped!</p>\\n<p>I feel someone putting a harness on my wings to keep them folded. I turn around to try to defend myself. The horror to see that it was Sophia who had just installed the harness for me. Darakei puts the harness back on a little so my wings are in the right position. I was too terrified to do anything.</p>\\n<p>Darakei and Sophia take me back to my room which will quickly become my cell. I sit on my bed while Darakei explains things I don't understand, my head is elsewhere. I stare at the wall in front of me. Why in the second of a phone call, I find myself imprisoned? What are they gonna tell my mom? And especially that if anything happens to me, my mother will sue GenCorp. I hear Darakei's voice and I notice his face in front of mine.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: Sam? Sam?<br>\\nSam: Hm?<br>\\nDarakei: Did you understand what I said?<br>\\nSam: Why am I no longer allowed to leave my room and communicate with the outside world?<br>\\nDarakei: I told you that superiors have made the decision to quarantine the New Humans since one of the newcomers has a dangerous power.<br>\\nSam: That doesn't answer the question...<br>\\nDarakei: You will soon be able to send messages to your mother again. I promise you that.<br>\\nSam: What if she tries to contact me again?<br>\\nDarakei: I would take the time to explain the situation.<br>\\nSam: How long is this gonna take?<br>\\nDarakei: I don't know.  </p>\\n<p>Darakei's phone is still ringing, he's looking at it fast.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: I have to go.</p>\\n<p>Darakei goes to the door, followed by Sophia.

Also, why didn't they take it away from me?</p>\\n<p>I'm gonna get up and sit at my table. I had paper and a pencil. I start to write how I feel and then as time goes on, I feel like I'll never get out of here... I catch myself drawing a suit I might have so people don't recognize me. I crumple the paper into a ball and throw it in a corner. I hear the door in front of mine opening. I go in front of the little window to look through and see that they bring a young woman into a bed. Looks like she's asleep. One of the guards notices me and signals me to move from there. I'm not moving, I'm just looking. The two guards finish installing it and I hear them talking a little. I can kind of understand what's being said.
