She salutes me with her hand.</p>\n<p>Blonde: Hi, can I sit down?<br>\nGaia: Uh, yes if you want.<br>\nBlonde: Thank you.</p>\n<p>She sits in front of me and pulls a little on her uniform, she seems uncomfortable in it.</p>\n<p>Yura: By the way, I'm Yura, I'm new here.<br>\nGaia: Gaia, nice to meet you, I hope you like it here.<br>\nYura: Me too, but the uniform doesn't help.<br>\nGaïa: You'll get used to it quickly, after that you won't even think about it.<br>\nYura: I hope!</p>\n<p>She's laughing, clearly, she wasn't from the country.</p>\n<p>Gaia: Why did you move here?<br>\nYura: My father changed jobs and I didn't have much choice but to follow him.<br>\nGaia: I see.</p>\n<p>I take a bite of my sandwich and look ahead.</p>\n<p>Gaia: You got dinner?<br>\nYura: No, sparrow's appetite.<br>\nGaïa: Oh, you're not even a little hungry?<br>\nYura: Nan~</p>\n<p>I nod gently, no need to insist.</p>\n<p>Yura: Would you mind showing me around the school after lunch?<br>\nGaia: No worries.</p>\n<p>I take another bite and Yura looks at my nails. I hide them by reflex.</p>\n<p>Yura: Your nails are pretty, a beautiful natural green patent.<br>\nGaïa: Really? Do you like it? Well, thank you.</p>\n<p>I smile, reassured she thinks it's varnish. After five minutes, I finished eating and put my food in my lunch box.</p>\n<p>Gaia: I'll carry this in my locker and then show you around the school?<br>\nYura: Cool! You are so nice!<br>\nGaia: Thank you Yura.</p>\n<p>Yura smiles and looks around as I finish putting away my food. I get up and Yura does the same. She almost falls because of the skirt and complains a little. I laugh softly as I place my hand in front of my mouth. Yura looks at me and laughs. She stands up and smiles.</p>\n<p>Yura: Did you see how I almost finished first on the floor? That would have been elegant!<br>\nGaia: Yeah, you really need to get used to the uniform.</p>\n<p>Yura smiles and nods. We're finally going to my locker, where I keep my stuff.</p>\n<p>By the end of lunch time, I was done touring the school with Yura. She was very nice and fun. We exchange phone numbers to meet after school.</p>\n<p>I think I finally got a friend who doesn't just like me for my good grades in class. In fact, Yura is a very smart girl, maybe even more than me. Yura leaves her side waving to me, I return the sign. I'm going back to my locker to pick up my afternoon course books.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, we meet in front of the inner garden, I have the impression that my power calmed down, it is reassuring. Yura was talking to a guy on the sports team, she had her arms crossed and was leaning against a locker. Yura sees me approaching and says hi to the guy. He looks at me and Yura. He leaves without asking for the rest. Yura approaches and stretches out her arm so that we place ourselves arm in arm. I smile and place myself.</p>\n<p>Yura: Shall we go to my place? I have a few boxes to unpack, but nothing urgent.<br>\nGaïa: If you want, I'll just tell my parents I'm going to a friend's house before I go home.<br>\nYura: Good!</p>\n<p>I text my mom and dad and we're off to Yura's. Yura wanted to take the bus, but she changes her mind when she sees how many people want to do the same thing. I ask her to walk, she smiles and we start walking. She wasn't staying far from my house, actually. Only 20 minutes' walk separated our houses.</p>\n<p>I go inside her house and take off my shoes, like she does.</p>\n<p>Yura: I'll go change if you don't mind, I'm already tired of the uniform.<br>\nGaia: Make yourself at home.<br>\nYura: Well, I'm home.</p>\n<p>She winked at me and left for what I can assume to be her room. She was already starting to unbutton her shirt. I look around me, several boxes were stacked. I step forward and sit on a chair in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Yura arrives a few minutes later, jeans and camisole as a suit, hair detached in addition. I smile when I see her.</p>\n<p>Gaia: I see you look more comfortable.<br>\nYura: So much! You don't know how it feels good. I won't break my face when I fall because of the skirt!<br>\nGaia: I believe you. So what do we do?<br>\nYura: I want to know something first.<br>\nGaia: Go ahead?<br>\nYura: Your green nails, they're not patent, are they?<br>\nGaïa: Uh, I, yes, it's varnish... Why wouldn't it be?<br>\nYura: I think you have a power or something~<br>\nGaia: What? Power? Like people in movies and stories?<br>\nYura: Well, you're not very good at lying, but it's practiced. So, what's your power?<br>\nGaia: How do you know?<br>\nYura: You know what they say, we know our particularities about others.<br>\nGaïa: I don't really understand, you have a power too?<br>\nYura: Yep.<br>\nGaïa: Oh...<br>\nYura: Actually, we're not the only ones with a power, my friend has one too and we're setting up a group of people with powers.<br>\nGaia: Seriously?<br>\nYura: Yeah, when we have enough people, we can set up bank robberies and lots of fun stuff~<br>\nGaia: What do you mean, bank robberies? I wouldn't be a part of this!</p>\n<p>I get up from the chair and start going to the door. I feel Yura's hand grabbing my wrist. I start screaming and struggling, but she's so strong. She puts me face down and sits on top of me. I'm trying to get rid of his catch.</p>\n<p>The apartment door opens and I see a pair of shoes approaching.</p>\n<p>Gaia: Help! She wants to hurt me!</p>\n<p>The man kneels before me and Yura straightens me up so I can sit too. I'm trying to struggle, the man was on Yura's side.</p>\n<p>The man approaches his thumbs to my forehead and suddenly, the total white.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-2-disruptions-in-class",chapitreApres:null,nomRoman:"power-of-nature",slug:"chapter-3-new-friend",codeChapitre:"H0006C003",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-3-la-nouvelle-amie"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-3-new-friend"}}}});
