Maybe my dad hasn't arrived from work yet. If that's the case, I should hurry and leave. I'm gonna take a quick shower and get dressed. I'm gonna make myself some dinner, I was gonna be a good two hours early for school, but whatever. I'm gonna go wait in the park.</p>\\n<p>I look quickly in the hall, no boots or jackets. My dad's actually not back from work yet. I hear that the bread has finished roasting and will put some strawberry spread and start eating while preparing my dinner for school. I'll put everything in my bag and eat the last bites of my meal. I'll hurry before my dad gets here. I put on my shoes quickly and take my bag. Right as I was about to open the door to get out, my dad opens it. I'm reflexing back. My dad looks up and down at me.</p>\\n<p>My father: So you wait for your father before you go to school?<br>\\nTim: Hello, father.<br>\\nMy dad: Come on, get out of my way, kid.</p>\\n<p>My father pushes me away by taking off his jacket and boots. I can't wait to get out of here, I've had enough. I'm leaving without even saying goodbye to my father. I go to the park which is halfway between school and home.</p>\\n<p>I would sit on a bench, the sun would rise quietly and the rays would pass through the clouds in the sky. I take a deep breath closing my eyes. If my dad had started hitting me, I know I wouldn't have been able to resist the urge to get super muscular and finally punch him in the face. A man in a full shirt and tie sits next to me. He was bald and wore sunglasses.</p>\\n<p>The man: It's a beautiful sunrise, isn't it?<br>\\nTim: Um, yeah.<br>\\nThe man: You know you were filmed yesterday during your incident?<br>\\nTim: Excuse me? How do you know about that?<br>\\nMan: It was the company I work for that shut the case down.<br>\\nTim: What do you want from me?<br>\\nThe man: I don't have the clearance to answer you, but my supervisor would like to speak with you.<br>\\nTim: I won't talk to anyone, leave me alone.</p>\\n<p>I get up and start leaving.</p>\\n<p>The man: You have something special, Tim, and that special thing can be dangerous for you or others.<br>\\nTim: Leave me alone I tell you.</p>\\n<p>I turn around and see that the man is still sitting and watching me go. I turned around to see where I was going and there he was, right in front of me.</p>\\n<p>The man: You will follow me willingly or forcibly. It's for your safety.<br>\\nTim: I told you to leave me alone!</p>\\n<p>I clenched my fist and went to hit him. My arm had grown in a split second. While I was hitting him, I noticed he's gone. I feel something stinging in my neck. I fall asleep in the moment that follows.</p>\\n<p>I open my eyes and look around. A man with tousled blond hair, a beard and a pair of nerdy glasses sat on a chair in front of me.</p>\\n<p>Tim: Who are you?! Where am I? Why did you take me?!<br>\\nDarakei: My name is Darakei Drumel, you are in one of GenCorp's secondary labs. So I can explain what's going on with you and your power.</p>\\n<p>I have so many questions in my head, but I can only ask one.</p>\\n<p>Tim: What do you mean a power?<br>\\nDarakei: Obviously, you have a power that allows you to increase your strength.<br>\\nTim: How do you know?<br>\\nDarakei: That's what you can see on the video and that my employee confirmed about you.<br>\\nTim: And you want to hurt me for that?<br>\\nDarakei: Not at all. In fact, we want to help you control your power and avoid hurting yourself or civilians.<br>\\nTim: How do you want to help me? Besides, I have classes to take.<br>\\nDarakei: If you agree to take the program, your education will continue here and your family will receive money to thank you for participating in the program.<br>\\nTim: You're not sending money to my stupid father.<br>\\nDarakei: The money can be paid into your bank account in this case.<br>\\nTim: I'd prefer that, but I don't really understand the story. Do I have a power or something?<br>\\nDarakei: Yes, you have a power because of a gene that is going from latent to active. If you wish, we can give you an injection to help with the transition.</p>\\n<p>I look at him, perplexed and hesitant. What would that involve? Could I still see Cassia? I would be fed and housed? There are still many questions in my head.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: So Tim, do you still have questions?<br>\\nTim: Yes. I would be fed and housed?<br>\\nDarakei: Yes, of course.<br>\\nTim: Could I still go to the café?<br>\\nDarakei: No, unfortunately, you will not live here, but in Damonia.<br>\\nTim: Oh... so I couldn't see Cassia again.<br>\\nDarakei: It's evil for good. If you stay here, there's a good chance the police will find you.<br>\\nTim: What do you mean, find by the police?<br>\\nDarakei: Someone who demonstrates this kind of phenomenon, the police can only see it as a potential threat. And as much as I cover it up by making it look like a fake video. The witnesses know what they saw.<br>\\nTim: So I have no choice but to leave?<br>\\nDarakei: Not really, at least, until we forget you.<br>\\nTim: Oh well great.</p>\\n<p>I'm looking up at the ceiling, thinking. On the one hand, I'm super strong and now I can defend myself with this. But on the other hand, I risk my life going out like that and the police could find me. I see no other option but to accept.</p>\\n<p>Tim: Okay, I'll come with you, but when this is all over, I wish I could go home.<br>\\nDarakei: Of course, Tim. Besides, I can assure you, you won't be the only one living there.</p>\\n<p>That's how we leave for GenCorp's laboratory, in another city several hundred kilometres from my home.</p>\"}},\"chapitreAvant\":\"chapter-1-imminent-danger\",\"chapitreApres\":\"chapter-3-be-strong\",\"nomRoman\":\"the-calpeo-monster\",\"slug\":\"chapter-2-meeting\",\"codeChapitre\":\"H0007C002\",\"equivalentUrl\":\"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-2-rencontre\"}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"chapter-2-meeting\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---en-stories-chapter-chapter-2-meeting-030df6f9ef1248bc98e0.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"contentfulChapitre\":{\"titreChapitre\":\"Chapter 2 - Meeting\",\"texte\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>When I wake up, there's no noise in the house.
