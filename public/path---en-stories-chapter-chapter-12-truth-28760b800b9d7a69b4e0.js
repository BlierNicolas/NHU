I decide to get up too and go see her, as I open the door of my room, Clara is right in front of me about to knock.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Oh hi.<br>\nClara: Hi, I didn't think you were awake.<br>\nWamien: I don't sleep much.</p>\n<p>I smile. It is true that I sleep much less than before, I eat much less too.</p>\n<p>Clara: When I sleep, I sleep like a baby.</p>\n<p>She laughs, like an angel, her voice soft at all times. I'm blushing.</p>\n<p>Clara: Oh here, a color on your skin. That's cute.<br>\nWamien: Stop it, it's not intended.</p>\n<p>We laugh for a moment. I lose my smile when I think I should tell him who I really am.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Clara? I-I have something to tell you.</p>\n<p>I look away and swallow my saliva. She smiles at me, she's so beautiful.</p>\n<p>Clara: I think I know.<br>\nWamien: Oh, really?<br>\nClara: Yeah, just seeing you do it shows right away.</p>\n<p>She slowly approaches me smiling.</p>\n<p>Wamien: You know I'm a cyborg?</p>\n<p>She changes her facial expression all of a sudden and moves back a little.</p>\n<p>Clara: What are you? No, that's not possible.<br>\nWamien: I'm a cyborg, I'm not 100% human like you.<br>\nClara: H-how's that?<br>\nWamien: I don't know. It is like that and that's it, I know I was human before, but I don't know what caused this change.<br>\nClara: I... can I see?</p>\n<p>I raise the sleeve of my t-shirt and lower the skin letting see the pieces and metal plates of my arm. Clara looks at it mouth open and approaches her hand.</p>\n<p>Clara: Wow... And, and for your face.<br>\nWamien: Just the right eye, the rest is human.<br>\nClara: Oh, all right. I-I can touch?</p>\n<p>I nod gently and she approaches her hand on the metal plates that make up my arm and I smile, happy to see that her reaction is not as negative as I would have thought.</p>\n<p>Clara: Wamien?...<br>\nWamien: Yes?<br>\nClara: Did the people you were running from yesterday do this to you?<br>\nWamien: Yes.<br>\nClara: Why were you running from them?<br>\nWamien: I'd better shut up. That's because I was in a lab where genetic experiments were done on humans to give them powers.<br>\nClara: Powers? What kind?<br>\nWamien: Flying, generating fire or ice, premonition, ultra flexible body, that sort of thing.<br>\nClara: You wanna know my secret?<br>\nWamien: Why?</p>\n<p>Clara took a knife and opened her palm a little.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Nah, you're crazy!</p>\n<p>I don't realize right now that her skin is already closing in a little blue glow. She's capable of healing herself.</p>\n<p>Clara: I can heal myself and others' wounds.</p>\n<p>She blushes a little and turns her head down by biting her finger a little.</p>\n<p>Wamien: How is that possible?<br>\nClara: I don't know, but I've been able to do this since I was 15, five years ago.<br>\nWamien: Is that why you work in a hospital?<br>\nClara: And I don't know why, but I feel like I can feel when people have something special. Like you, I felt you had something special.</p>\n<p>I smile and blush a little in front of all these revelations. She also blushes by raising her head a little towards me.</p>\n<p>Wamien: You don't know the weight it takes away from me to know you're like me.<br>\nClara: Yes.</p>\n<p>She approaches slowly and huddles in my arms. I look at her and hold her gently against me. She lifts her head a little to look me in the eye.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-11-the-new-house",chapitreApres:"chapter-13-rebellion-part-1",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-1",slug:"chapter-12-truth",codeChapitre:"H0001C012",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-12-la-verite"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-12-truth"}}}});
