One of the men tries to stick a knife into Kellan's ribs, but the blade breaks into a thousand pieces. The guy steps back and signals the others to step back as well, showing the knife. Kellan comes to and looks at the men around him.</p>\n<p>Kellan: What do you want from me?<br>\nMan 1: Nothing, man, everything's fine.<br>\nKellan: Everything okay? Everything's fine! Did you see what happened with me?</p>\n<p>The men are retreating and seem to be afraid. I grab the first man's sweater I can reach. The other guys around pull guns and point them at me. My eyes turn red of anger and I throw the man I'm holding at another man. The two men are flying at least 10 meters. The other five men start shooting at me. I protect my face with my arm, but I feel the gun bullets as if people are throwing snowballs at me. I run up to one of the men and send him waltzing on a bench.</p>\n<p>The gang gets smaller as I knock the men out one after the other. I start to come to myself when the last one begs me to spare him when I was about to give him the fatal punch. I drop him and start running in the other direction. Police car sirens are beginning to be heard. The gunshots must have freaked out the neighbors. </p>\n<p>Where can I hide while I wait for it to pass? The forest maybe? I put my huge hand through my hair in front of this question. I'm gonna go into the forest, it's the only solution I see right now. I start running towards the forest. The sirens are approaching the park. I go into the forest and go far enough so the police can't see me. When I'm sure everything's fine, I sit against a tree and think about it. I look at my hands, my arms, my chest with my sweater pretty torn and damaged from the gunshot and the stabbing attempt. My pants which are now the equivalent of tight shorts. If I'm gonna stay like this, my clothes will never do. Why I'm just this way. I end up falling asleep with all his questions.</p>\n<p>When I woke up, I realized it wasn't a bad dream. I'm still a giant, my body hasn't changed. I became a monster, but not just any kind of monster, now I would be able to defend myself and get whatever I wanted. I get up with the determination of a new man, I look around me.</p>\n<p>Kellan: Well... which way should I go?</p>\n<p>I bite my lip and try to think about where I came from last night. It was pretty dark last night, so some details should jump out at me. I keep looking around. The tree that had fallen, the end that touches the ground was pointing to my right. So if I stand across the street and turn around. I should be able to get out of the woods. I hear a car passing by on a nearby street. I just have to follow the noise where the car was.</p>\n<p>I start walking in this direction and I arrive at the edge of the forest. There were security gates and police with paramedics picking up the bodies of the men who attacked me yesterday. I leave the forest and decide to pass by another street. People look at me and seem to wonder what happened to me. I don't look at them. I just want to go home and lie in my bed. People are packing up to let me pass, and some are clearly afraid of me. I'm really different from the others. I measure one head or two more than the others. I finally get home, my neighbor recognizes me and looks at me with big eyes. I don't know and go home using my key. I open the door and realize that I have to tilt my head if I want to enter without bumping into the top of the door frame. So I go home and close the door. I come face to face with my mother. She starts screaming, scared.</p>\n<p>My mother: Who the hell are you?<br>\nKellan: It's me, Kellan.<br>\nMy mother: No! That's impossible! What did you do?!<br>\nKellan: I didn't do anything! Suddenly I changed, as if someone had made me take a product to increase my muscle mass!<br>\nMy mother: You're talking nonsense! I've had enough of your lies!</p>\n<p>My father came into the room and looked up, now it was clear I was taller than him.</p>\n<p>My father: What the hell have you done now?<br>\nKellan: But I didn't do anything!<br>\nFather: I call the police, you must have taken a drug or something.<br>\nKellan: No! You're not calling the police!</p>\n<p>I grab the phone before my dad and crush the phone.</p>\n<p>Kellan: Oh shit...<br>\nMy father: Are you completely sick or what?!<br>\nKellan: Maybe! I don't know what's happening to me.<br>\nFather: There's no way you're staying here, there's no way a monster is staying with me.<br>\nKellan: For once I'm not a weak person with weak bones. You want to kick me out.</p>\n<p>My parents kept quiet and looked at each other, it was true that my parents had often reproached me for being weak and fragile. Now it's completely the opposite. My father seems to be thinking. My little sister comes into the kitchen and looks up at me. She's starting to laugh.</p>\n<p>Ophelia: Ahahah! You should see the stupid face you're making.<br>\nKellan: Oh you shut up.<br>\nMy mother: Kellan.<br>\nKellan: What?<br>\nMy mother: You got shot?<br>\nKellan: Yes, last night...<br>\nMy mother: Why is your skin okay?<br>\nKellan: I don't know. I just want to go to my room and rest.<br>\nMy father: No, you will explain everything to us first.<br>\nKellan: I was sitting in the park, I started to really hurt, all over myself and a few seconds later I was like that. A gang attacked me, they tried to stab me or something and then they shot me when they saw the knives had done nothing. I got angry, I beat them up and then as the police arrived I went to hide in the forest. I woke up, I came home and that was it.<br>\nMy mom: The gang in the park next door?<br>\nKellan: Yes.<br>\nMy mother: The 6 young people who are injured on the threshold of death?<br>\nKellan: Maybe, but they shot me like I was something to hunt.</p>\n<p>My mom's backing up scared.</p>\n<p>My mother: On the news, they say a wild beast attacked them all.<br>\nKellan: I'm not a wild beast.</p>\n<p>I go to my room, tired of it all. My parents don't dare impose, a good thing. As I pass, my sister stares at me. Always a spoiled little bitch with everything she wants. I ignore her, go to my room and close the door.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-1-fragile",chapitreApres:"chapter-3-news-allies",nomRoman:"the-black-eagles-mastodon",slug:"chapter-2-attack-in-the-park",codeChapitre:"H0009C002",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-2-attaque-au-parc"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-2-attack-in-the-park"}}}});
