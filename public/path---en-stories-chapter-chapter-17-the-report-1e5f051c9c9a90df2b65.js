I stand on a nearby roof and observe in silence. There was a lot of light so you could see the Black Eagles making stuff. A woman with green hair would move boxes with vines to put them somewhere else. A little further on, there were two who seemed to be training, a skinny little guy who can make himself invisible and another normal size guy who knows how to control electricity. A guy, the same size as Tim, comes out of a tent with two twins to see a man, who was in his corner, playing with a sword. When the trio approached, his sword disappeared, as if it were a fake. A woman with black hair was standing back with a young man and was just talking. Except for them, I haven't seen anyone else. I stayed in position for a good half hour and then I came back.<br>\nWamien: Okay, Kameron, can you give names to the people he observed?<br>\nKameron: Yeah, the girl with green hair is Gaia. The skinny kid is Jack, his training partner was Theo. Tim's big guy was Kellan the second in the group, the twins who accompanied him were Sarah and Sandrine, they know how to create explosions... </p>\n<p>Clara wrote down everything we said to keep track of who is in this group and knows how to do what.</p>\n<p>Kameron:... The young man they went to see was Hiro, then the woman with black hair was probably Marie, a lie detector and then the other man was either Isao, Ray or Drake, the leader of the group.<br>\nWamien: Sam, you think if someone shows you a picture, you'll recognize him?<br>\nSam: Of course!</p>\n<p>Kemy gets up without a word and goes upstairs. She comes down two minutes later with the pictures of all the band members and post-its.</p>\n<p>Kemy: We'll write down the name and powers and hang them on the wall.\nWamien: Good idea, Kemy.</p>\n<p>Kameron shows Sam the pictures while Clara and Bailey record the names and powers to place them together. Alexis levitated a bulletin board and Louann went to get nails and drawing pins to nail the bulletin board to the wall.</p>\n<p>Sam: He was the one talking with Mary.<br>\nKameron: So it's Isao, he can handle memories. He's really dangerous, but not as dangerous as Ray, he knows how to control people's will.<br>\nWamien: Knowing what Drake looked like, we can put a picture on Ray and know we have to avoid him as much as possible.</p>\n<p>The photos and texts were placed so as to be able to know that above is the chief, Drake, a little lower the second Kellan, and from left to right the other members with an order of dangerousness. In order, Ray, Isao, Sarah and Sandrine, Jack, Hiro, Theo, Ga√Øa and Marie.</p>\n<p>Wamien: We'll have to train hard if we want to dismantle the band...<br>\nKameron: Yeah really.<br>\nTim: I could kick Drake's ass!<br>\nWamien: I wouldn't rush too much, Tim. If he's the boss, it's not without reason.<br>\nTim: Hmm.<br>\nClara: I'd say in a week at the most we're ready for surgery.<br>\nWamien: I agree with that deadline and you guys?</p>\n<p>Everyone else nodded except Saeko who had been silent all along.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-16-tracking",chapitreApres:"chapter-18-revelation",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-1",slug:"chapter-17-the-report",codeChapitre:"H0001C018",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-17-le-rapport"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-17-the-report"}}}});
