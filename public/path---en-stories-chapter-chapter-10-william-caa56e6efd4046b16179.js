They were trying to make themselves forgotten, but Wamien won't forget them. While he was thinking about all this in his room, Gaia came to see him.</p>\n<p>Gaia: Um, Wamien, excuse me for bothering you.<br>\nWamien : You don't bother me, Gaïa, what is it?<br>\nGaia: There's a young man who wants to see you, he says his name is William.<br>\nWamien : Tell him I'm coming.<br>\nGaia: Okay.</p>\n<p>She left the room by gently closing the door. Gaia was always shy with everyone, but when it came time to use her powers. She's not embarrassed or afraid.</p>\n<p>I go down a little later to go towards the front door and while passing in front of the living room I hear Gaïa calling me. So I turn around and go into the living room. A young man about 14-15 years old who was sitting and talking with Gaia.</p>\n<p>Wamien : Hello William.<br>\nWilliam: Good morning.</p>\n<p>William looked at Wamien and seemed a little intimidated.</p>\n<p>Wamien : You know you can be comfortable here, we don't mean you any harm.<br>\nWilliam: I know, I just want to know if... If I can join you.<br>\nWamien : Well, I don't know. Depends on a lot of things. Do you have a power? Are your parents okay with this?<br>\nWilliam: Yes, I have a power and then I am an orphan, my parents died four years ago.<br>\nWamien : Oh, my condolences, but how did you get here?</p>\n<p>William closed his eyes. A great sorrow invades me in a strange way. Persistent, she refused to leave despite all the good memories I tried to remember. I come to understand the power he possessed: Mood control.</p>\n<p>Gaia started crying.</p>\n<p>Gaïa : Oh, it's so sad! Wamien, we can't leave him like this.<br>\nWamien : I'll see who can accommodate him.<br>\nWilliam: As long as nobody knows I'm here, I can even sleep on the floor.<br>\nWamien : Why as long as nobody knows I'm here?<br>\nWilliam : I did some stupid things trying to get here... Involuntarily of course, but still.<br>\nWamien : Oh, I see.<br>\nWilliam : So I'd like it to remain silent until I'm forgotten a little, is that possible?<br>\nWamien : Yes it is possible.<br>\nWilliam: Thank you.  </p>\n<p>I smile at the young man.</p>\n<p>Wamien : But you must use your power for good, understand?<br>\nWilliam: No worries.<br>\nWamien : All right then, follow me, we'll find you a place where you can sleep.</p>\n<p>He nodded, ready to settle down. I go to the door of the house and open it at the same time to turn back to William.</p>\n<p>Wamien : If not, what is your full name?<br>\nWilliam: William Alexander.<br>\nWamien: William Alexander, mood control, right.</p>\n<p>I go to Hiro's house and when I get near his house, we can hear him training.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Go ahead, William.</p>\n<p>William goes in front and we go into Hiro's backyard. Hiro had made a sword appear and made movements that looked almost like a dance. William's facial expression is confused, he doesn't know if he should be impressed or start laughing. I decide to step forward and cough into my hand to get your attention. When Hiro realizes our presence, he makes his sword disappear and stands at attention.</p>\n<p>Hiro: Hello Chief!<br>\nWamien : Hi, Hiro, you know you don't need to do this?<br>\nHiro: I know Chef.<br>\nWamien : Well, get back to your usual routine.</p>\n<p>Hiro stops standing at attention and smiles at William.</p>\n<p>Hiro: Who is this young man?<br>\nWamien : I let you introduce yourself, William?<br>\nWilliam: William Alexander, I have the power to control people's emotions.<br>\nWamien : William is an orphan, so we're looking for someone who can teach him how to control his powers and who can provide him with a place to sleep.<br>\nHiro : I would be happy to be his tutor and that he is my apprentice, on the other hand, I warn you, you will not have him easy every day little man. I am a strict and severe person!<br>\nWilliam: A bit like my mother, it won't change.<br>\nHiro: So welcome to my home, William!</p>\n<p>I smile, the two already seem to get along well. I leave them both and will contact Darakei to see if we have any news about the Black Eagles and The Legion. I go home and get my phone before I contact Darakei.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Hello Wamien.<br>\nWamien : Hello, Darakei, any news about the bands we're looking for?<br>\nDarakei : Still not, I'm studying a way to better find those who have the genes to be new humans.<br>\nWamien: That's good news. On the other hand, the Black Eagles and The Legion will end up making a goof that will allow us to find them.<br>\nDarakei : I reassure you that all authorities are on the alert and have portraits of all members.<br>\nWamien: That's something. If I can help you with the genes, don't hesitate.<br>\nDarakei : Actually, I would need you and some other Guild members for a blood test.<br>\nWamien : Ah? Okay, if you can send me a list don't hesitate.<br>\nDarakei: I'll send it to you tonight.<br>\nWamien : No problem, when will you want to see us?<br>\nDarakei: The sooner the better, but there is no rush.<br>\nWamien : I'll talk to the people on the list.<br>\nDarakei: All right, see you then.<br>\nWamien : See you soon.</p>\n<p>We hang up and I wait to see the list that Darakei will send me.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-9-new-familly",chapitreApres:"chapter-11-the-drumel-genes",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-2",slug:"chapter-10-william",codeChapitre:"H0002C010",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-10-william"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-10-william"}}}});
