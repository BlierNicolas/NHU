She sighed and dressed warmly, as the nights began to get cold.</p>\n<p>Angélique : I have to join them, a chance that I hid the card that Wamien gave me.</p>\n<p>She climbs on a small bench and takes the card she had hidden on the top of her dresser, she finishes making her bag without making too much noise to avoid waking her mother. She put her bag on her back and sighed gently so that her skin would stop shining like this. She walked past the kitchen and took a box of cookies and two bottles of water. She was planning on taking her bike for the road. She left her house to climb on her bike and finally set off. She began to produce a little light to illuminate before her. She was pedaling without looking back. She was trying to reach the border between Abaltia and Deracus to try to contact The Guild. She couldn't get through customs because she didn't have her passport. She would go through the small villages on the road and think about how she would explain the fact that her mother had not kept her promise and that she had not come to wear it 3 weeks earlier. Three big black vehicles passed by her, it was quite rare to see this kind of vehicles on the less important roads, but well, she continued her road. After a few hours on her bike, she started to run out of steam a little and decided to take a short break, the sun was rising. It was a wonderful sight. She stood there looking at the sun and stopped emanating light as it was no longer necessary. She got back on the road around 6am, cars were starting to circulate, her mother would probably soon notice her absence and try to contact her. She wouldn't answer, not until she joined The Guild to give them help about how she felt. She finally arrived at customs around 8:00 in the morning. The customs officer looks at her a little surprised to see a teenager wanting to go through customs alone.</p>\n<p>Customs officer: You know you have to be accompanied by an adult to clear customs.<br>\nAngélique: I know, sir. I want to contact The Guild.<br>\nThe customs officer: I don't know any \" The Guild\", go home young lady.<br>\nAngélique : I have their address, do you think you can find the phone number?</p>\n<p>Angélique took out Wamien's card and handed it to the customs officer. The customs officer took the card, entered the address into his computer while keeping an eye on the teenage girl. The customs officer made big eyes when he read what was written on his computer.</p>\n<p>The customs officer: And why do you want to go there?<br>\nAngélique : I need to answer this question?<br>\nCustoms officer: Yes.<br>\nAngélique : I need their help to learn to better control my power...<br>\nThe customs officer: Your power?</p>\n<p>The customs officer pressed a button on his computer to warn the emergency room that one of the New Humans was trying to get through customs. Within seconds the customs officer's phone rang and he answered immediately.</p>\n<p>Customs officer: Yes? No, she didn't. Yeah, I'm fine... What is she, a 15-16 year old?</p>\n<p>Angélique was looking at the customs officer, it was all suspicious. She hesitated to force the way and go to The Guild, but if she did that, she would get into trouble.</p>\n<p>The customs officer: All right, I'll contact him.</p>\n<p>The customs officer hung up.</p>\n<p>Customs officer: Wait a minute please, I have to make a call.<br>\nAngélique : Who should you call?<br>\nCustoms officer: I am not allowed to answer that question.</p>\n<p>The customs officer dialed the number and picked up the phone.</p>\n<p>Customs officer: Good morning, sir, there is a young girl who says she wants to go to The Guild and I was told that it was you I should contact.</p>\n<p>Angélique thought maybe it was Wamien and decided to try it.</p>\n<p>Angélique: Wamien, it's Angélique! Tell the man to let me through!</p>\n<p>The customs officer stared at the girl, what was she trying to do. The customs officer decided to focus on the appeal.</p>\n<p>The customs officer: Yes, um, two seconds... It's noted, I'll call this number then.</p>\n<p>The customs officer sighed and hung up, he didn't think he had to do that kind of thing. So he called the new number he had been given.</p>\n<p>Customs officer: Hello, um, Wamien Mata? Yes, there is a certain Angélique who... Uh, she's alone, she seems to have been on her bike. No, I'm not allowed to let her pass. You have to come and get her. In two hours? Okay, but just so you know, customs isn't a day care center.</p>\n<p>Angélique looked at the customs officer and noticed the rest area next door.</p>\n<p>Angélique: I'll go wait here, thank you, sir.<br>\nCustoms officer: Don't forget your card.</p>\n<p>Angélique took her card and went to sit on a table in the rest area. She waited wisely at the table, ignoring her mother's calls. She wouldn't answer it, she wouldn't understand me. A winged man's figure passed over his head. She looked up to the sky and saw a young man land and retract his wings to make them disappear and head for the customs post. Angélique got up and packed her backpack. Maybe he was the one who would come looking for her. Angélique approached and when she was close enough. She saw the customs officer pointing at her.</p>\n<p>The customs officer: She was the one who asked to speak with Wamien.<br>\nSam : Thank you, have a nice day sir.</p>\n<p>The young man turns to me.</p>\n<p>Sam : Hello, Angélique, my name is Sam, I am a member of The Guild.<br>\nAngélique: Hello Sam. I'd like to join you.<br>\nSam : No problem, your power is about light, right?<br>\nAngélique : Yes, will we be able to go to The Guild?<br>\nSam: Is your mom okay with you joining us after all?<br>\nAngélique: Yes yes.<br>\nSam: All right then.</p>\n<p>Sam went to an open place and took out his wings. Angélique came to him.</p>\n<p>Angélique : Heum, will you be able to fly if I hold my bike?<br>\nSam: Yeah, but you're gonna have to hold it tight.</p>\n<p>Angélique: We do that then.</p>\n<p>Let's get settled in and take off. I should be in The Guild by noon, finally.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-6-union",chapitreApres:"chapter-8-without-success",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-2",slug:"chapter-7-the-getaway",codeChapitre:"H0002C007",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-7-escapade"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-7-the-getaway"}}}});
