I tried to stay focused on class, but it was pretty hard.</p>\n<p>Father: So, big guy, how was your day?<br>\nJack: Good, even though I had trouble staying focused during class.<br>\nFather: You will ask your classmates for help if you need their notes.<br>\nJack: Yeah, I don't know, I don't really have any friends, you know, Dad.<br>\nMy dad: Could it help you worry maybe? If you make comrades for the revision.<br>\nJack: Yes, maybe.</p>\n<p>I was a shy and discreet person, I don't like to disturb people by my presence. Like what, my power goes well with the way I live. We get home, I get out of the car and take my bag from the back seat. My father smiles gently at me. I'll smile back and open the door. I go in and take off my shoes and jacket.</p>\n<p>Jack: I'll do my homework and then I'll practice.<br>\nMy dad: Perfect, big guy.</p>\n<p>I go to my room and close the door. I open my bag and take out my homework. I finish them pretty quickly, nothing very difficult. I put everything in my bag so I don't forget my homework. I get up and stand in front of my mirror to practice.</p>\n<p>After two hours, I have a good facility to change state. The challenge now is to keep this state, but to move at the same time. My father knocks on my bedroom door. I turn my head towards the door.</p>\n<p>Jack: Yeah?<br>\nFather: Jack, dinner's ready.<br>\nJack: I'm coming, Dad.</p>\n<p>I turn my head back to the mirror and see that I was still invisible. Would I have succeeded? I try to move my hand and I do remain invisible. I become visible again and go into the kitchen where my father finished placing the table. I make myself invisible and go pull my chair. My father is looking in my direction.</p>\n<p>My dad: I knew you'd joke to me Jack, it's not working.</p>\n<p>I become visible again and smile at him.</p>\n<p>Jack: Don't you notice I can stay invisible and move?<br>\nMy father: Oh, oh! Indeed! Congratulations. The joke took all my attention, I didn't even realize your progress.<br>\nJack: That's okay.</p>\n<p>I sit in my chair and wait for my father to do the same. My dad sits down too and we start eating. I'm a little disappointed in my father's reaction. I explain to my father the training I've done since we got home. My father nods but it shows he doesn't really understand what I'm saying.</p>\n<p>Father: You know Jack, I may not understand everything that's going on with you, but don't forget I'm still proud of you and your progress.<br>\nJack: Okay, thanks Dad.</p>\n<p>We finish eating and I do the dishes while my father goes back to his office to work. I wonder if I can do more than make myself invisible. I finish the dishes and go back to my room. I can hear the conversation my father's having on the phone.</p>\n<p>My father: Yes, I tell you, he has a power of invisibility. And he masters it more and more. That's impressive.</p>\n<p>There is a moment of silence, as if my father's interlocutor was speaking.</p>\n<p>My father: No, he won't become a guinea pig, that's out of the question.</p>\n<p>I dream where my father is one of those who can be dangerous to me.</p>\n<p>My father: He can help with my research instead, he is as brilliant as I am, if not more so. He's a 17-year-old too, so don't forget that.</p>\n<p>I wonder what they're talking about, but maybe it's something that's not very clear. I don't know who I can trust anymore if my dad's on the wrong side. </p>\n<p>My father: How is it not my decision? This is my son we're talking about! I'm telling you, he can help me with my research. This is way more important than your stupid experiments.</p>\n<p>He defends me, maybe he only wants what's best for me after all. Should I take a chance and stay here? I don't know about that. Tomorrow, I'll see if I can sleep over at a friend's house. Maybe it'll change things a little if I'm not here when people want to experiment on me. They won't know where to find me.</p>\n<p>I go to my room and sit on my bed. I pick up my phone and send a message to my friend Rhory Flinn. He doesn't take long to answer me. We have a little message exchange and I ask him if I can sleep over. He tells me his parents aren't here for the week so I can stay as long as I want all week. At least he doesn't have to walk when he goes home and he can take the bus directly. I say hi to Rhory and lie in bed. There's so much going on. How am I gonna handle this? Especially since I don't want my friend to know I have a power that could put him in danger. I put my phone on the bedside table and get up.</p>\n<p>Jack: If I want to defend myself and my friends, I have to learn to fight.</p>\n<p>I'll turn on my TV and watch self-defense videos on the networks. I try to imitate what the instructor does in the video, but there are some movements I can't do because of the lack of space in my room. My dad comes knocking on my door and I startle. I grab the remote and pause the video.</p>\n<p>Jack: Yes Dad?</p>\n<p>My father opens the door to my room and enters my room a little.</p>\n<p>Father: I have a meeting tomorrow night, I don't know if I could pick you up.<br>\nJack: It's okay, I'll sleep over at a friend's tomorrow.<br>\nMy father: A friend?<br>\nJack: Dad, come on, I said a friend.<br>\nMy father: You never know. But I can drive you to school tomorrow, that's for sure.<br>\nJack: Okay, thank you.<br>\nMy father: What exactly are you doing?<br>\nJack: I watch videos and try to do the same.</p>\n<p>My dad nods and starts closing the door.</p>\n<p>Father: Don't forget to take a shower before bed.<br>\nJack: How old do you think I am?<br>\nFather: Even at 17, you may forget to take a shower.<br>\nJack: Dad, come on...</p>\n<p>My dad laughs and closes my bedroom door. I sighed and finished watching the video before going to the shower and going to bed.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-1-chase-race",chapitreApres:"chapter-3-the-vigilante",nomRoman:"the-invisible-defender",slug:"chapter-2-let-the-training-begin",codeChapitre:"H0008C002",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-2-que-l-entrainement-commence"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-2-let-the-training-begin"}}}});
