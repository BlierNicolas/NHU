I go to my room and take out the piece of paper Clara gave me. I wonder if I have the right to go out for anything other than missions... why I ask myself this question, of course not. I'm just a tool for them... anyway, I want to eat. I get up from my bed and go out of the room, two guards are there and one seemed to go knocking at the door.</p>\n<p>Guard 1: Oh, we are going to ask you a question.<br>\nWamien : Say...<br>\nGuard 1: We need you to decrypt the data Mr. Stephan had in his possession.<br>\nWamien : Can I eat something first?<br>\nGuard 1: Heum, you should ask Mr Drumel first.<br>\nWamien : Drumel? Who is that? Darakei?<br>\nGuard 1: Heum yes Darakei it is his first name...<br>\nWamien : I'm going to go set up and decrypt your stuff... but I want to have something to eat.<br>\nGuard 1: We'll see later...</p>\n<p>I sigh slightly, Darakei Drumel, strangely, that last name rings a bell. The two guards take me to the computer room. I sat in front of a computer and connected to it, there were some hard disks and five USB keys stored in bags, they are those of Mikhaël Stephan.</p>\n<p>Wamien : Good at work...<br>\nDarakei: Wamien?<br>\nWamien : Yes?<br>\nDarakei: Someone will bring you food, but don't eat too much okay?<br>\nWamien : Heum agreed.<br>\nDarakei: Oh and Wamien.<br>\nWamien : Yes?<br>\nDarakei : Congratulations on your mission, I hope you're not disappointed to have had more challenges.<br>\nWamien : It's okay...</p>\n<p>He smiled and left. Indeed, a young woman brought me food, she was small and had black hair like coal. She puts a meal tray on the corner of the table and leaves. She's so beautiful, I should have asked her name. I shake my head negatively. No, she knows me and she knows what I am. I start with the hard drive of Mikhaël's computer. After two hours, it is finally decrypted.</p>\n<p>Wamien: A good thing done, the other disks now.</p>\n<p>I install the other disks and USB sticks and spend another four hours there. It must be 23 hours. I can no longer hear the scientists passing by me or just walking down the hall. I get up, my gears crack. Something must be misplaced. I feel it in my back when I move my hips. I'm going back to my room, finally I haven't even eaten. I'm not hungry anymore. I will lie down and slowly open my back to try to remove the part that was unhooked. I take it out and throw it across the room.</p>\n<p>Wamien : Why me? Why do I have to go through all this? Why didn't I die? Instead of living like this? My parents, if I have any... where are they? What are they doing? Why don't they come get me?</p>\n<p>I close my eyes to these thoughts and pretend to sleep, think nothing more. Go brain dreams a little to see me in a better world...</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-6-the-encounter",chapitreApres:"chapter-8-friends",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-1",slug:"chapter-7-the-datas",codeChapitre:"H0001C007",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-7-les-donnees"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-7-the-datas"}}}});
