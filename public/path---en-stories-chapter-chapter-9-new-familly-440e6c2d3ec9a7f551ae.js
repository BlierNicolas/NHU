Guild members are exhausted.</p>\n<p>Wamien: All right, folks, get back to base. We have to give Angélique a proper welcome, too.</p>\n<p>I have a feeling we won't be able to find them anytime soon. But if we don't find them as soon as possible, they'll have time to prepare something evil. Clara prepares the dishes with Sarah and Gaïa for the arrival party of the newcomers, Angélique, Gabriel, Ezekiel and Thomas.</p>\n<p>Angélique was walking with Gabriel and was reuniting since they knew each other a little at school. Gabriel seemed more than happy to see her again. Some had fun alluding to the possible future of the two young people if they dated. Ezekiel was resting, he had spent the night training to better control his powers. So much so that I was helping Thomas better control his bone growth. Every time he stopped concentrating, bones would grow in his back or arms. He could not yet ignore the pain or simply control his power. At least where the bones grew, the skin would close gently.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Come on Thomas, you are capable, feel where the bones are trying to grow and hold them back. I know you can do this.<br>\nThomas: I try, but the pain.<br>\nWamien : Tame the pain, like with a pet that wants to stand up to you. Show him who the boss is in your body.</p>\n<p>Thomas was shaking. He was in pain, but I was hard on him, just because I knew he could do it and he shouldn't let the pain get to him. Thomas held back a cry of pain and three long spikes came out of his back, they had grown from his spine.</p>\n<p>Wamien : How are you Thomas?<br>\nThomas: It hurts like hell...<br>\nWamien: Okay, open your eyes and listen to me.</p>\n<p>Thomas opened his eyes and looked at me.</p>\n<p>Wamien: We change strategy, let out all the bones that want out of you, okay?<br>\nThomas : It already hurts enough just three bones like that, I'll die of pain if I let more out!<br>\nWamien : Trust me, the goal is to get them out without pain and especially to know how to retract them when you no longer need them.</p>\n<p>Thomas nodded and inhaled a good blow before letting out several bones at the level of his arms from his back and some bones grew at the level of his head. Thomas was clenching his teeth crying.</p>\n<p>Wamien : Breathe in and out. Let your power take its toll.</p>\n<p>Thomas was trying to breathe as best he could, but the pain was preventing him from breathing properly.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Now focus on the bones that have grown on your head. You think you need to protect your head?<br>\nThomas: N... no.<br>\nWamien : So tell them everything's fine.<br>\nThomas : Everything is fine... Everything is fine...</p>\n<p>I smile as I see that the bones at the level of the head come in slowly.</p>\n<p>Wamien : Same thing with your arms, you need to defend yourself from pain?<br>\nThomas: No, I have to fight it...<br>\nWamien : Well, it's with your brain and your heart that you have to fight the pain. Not with your arms, so tell your arms they don't need to fight.<br>\nThomas: Understood, same for my back?<br>\nWamien: Same thing for your back.</p>\n<p>Thomas did so, retracting the bones of his arms and a little later the bones in his back.</p>\n<p>Wamien : Now, when you need them, you know you can take them out and put them away as you want.</p>\n<p>Thomas nodded with a smile and wiped away the tears that had run down his cheeks. I'm gonna take Thomas' sweater back and give it to him. He put it back on and put his hair back on.</p>\n<p>Thomas : Thank you Wamien.<br>\nWamien : That's nice. We'll join the others, your party will start soon.<br>\nThomas: Okay.</p>\n<p>He went smiling, happy to have learned to control his power simply by remaining calm and relaxed. I follow him and we go into the kitchen where the food was prepared. Sarah and Gaia start screaming scandal and Sarah hurries to get us out of the room.</p>\n<p>Sarah: Don't spoil the surprise!<br>\nWamien: It's okay, it's okay. We were just passing through.<br>\nSarah: Yeah, that's right!</p>\n<p>She laughs a little and gently closes the door.</p>\n<p>A few hours later, everyone was there and the party started. There were all kinds of dishes that the girls had prepared and everyone served themselves. I smiled, happy to see that everyone got along well. A little later in the evening, I place myself in the center of the room.</p>\n<p>Wamien : I would like to welcome once again the new members of The Guild! Your second family or new according to what you wish. You are welcome among us and I want you to improve your control of your powers while doing good around you!</p>\n<p>Everyone shouted and applauded my little speech and Hiro returned to show the music.</p>\n<p>The party ended around 22:00 and we started tidying up and cleaning up the place. Several have gone to sleep. The next few days were going to be quiet for The Guild, except for Wamien who kept looking for clues as to where the Black Eagles and The Legion were.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-8-without-success",chapitreApres:"chapter-10-william",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-2",slug:"chapter-9-new-familly",codeChapitre:"H0002C009",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-9-nouvelle-famille"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-9-new-familly"}}}});
