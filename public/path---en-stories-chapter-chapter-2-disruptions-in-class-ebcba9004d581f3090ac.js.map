I look at her and examine my hands. Is it because of me that my flower has grown so much in one night? I dress thinking about all this. I need to find out where this came from, but quietly.

He gives me a kiss on the forehead before he goes to work. As I rinse my dishes, my mother arrives, finishing putting on her jacket and tie. I can't believe she has to wear a tie to work. It's pretty funny knowing that it's one of the only jobs where women and men had to wear proper ties and clothes to work.</p>\\n<p>My mother: You want me to drive you to school?<br>\\nGaïa: No, thanks, I'll walk.<br>\\nMy mom: Whatever you say, sweetie, see you tonight.<br>\\nGaia: See you tonight, Mom.</p>\\n<p>My mom's leaving for work. I go out for a quick walk around the garden and walk to my greenhouse. I hear my plants, some want water and others are satisfied with their condition. So I enter my greenhouse, fill the watering can and water my plants quickly. The time I have to leave for school is coming, so I'm going home to pick up my bag and lock the door before I leave for school.</p>\\n<p>I have to take a brisk walk about 15 minutes before I get to school. As I arrive, I have time to take a quick tour of the school's inner garden and observe the plants that grow there. I think about it, when I'm on campus at my future botany school, I'll have to try to find someone to take over. Suddenly I see plants and their energy fibers again. I sigh softly and sit on the floor. I look at the garden tree and feel the energy flowing towards it. He seems to be getting a little fatter. I get up quickly and back up; it's me who's causing this, it's clear now. It stops growing when I'm far enough away. I look around, see if anyone saw what just happened. Some students come by, but they don't seem to have noticed, whew. I get out of the garden and go to my locker to get the textbooks for my morning classes. I come into the classroom and settle into my desk. I look out the window and think about everything I've been going through lately. Other students come in and wave their hands at me and call out to me, which brings me back to reality.</p>\\n<p>Gaia: Oh! Hi, how are you?</p>\\n<p>I exchange a little with my classmates, but no more. The other students soon arrive and the class begins. I try to stay attentive to the class, but it's difficult because of what I'm going through. The teacher calls out to me, I jump up and look at her.</p>\\n<p>Gaia: Yes? Excuse me?<br>\\nTeacher: Are you following us or do you have your head in the clouds?<br>\\nGaia: Sorry, my head was elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>Some students laugh and others look forward to the class resuming. I look towards the flower which is on the edge of the window; it has grown since the beginning of the course. Oh no, I don't understand what's happening to me and it scares me. I close my eyes and try to focus on something other than the flower.</p>\\n<p>Teacher: Gaia, please follow the class.<br>\\nGaïa: Sorry, I have a headache...<br>\\nTeacher: Try to concentrate anyway.</p>\\n<p>I nod, I do, but it's hard when you see a flower grow faster than normal.</p>\\n<p>Student 1: Madam, you saw, the flower is strange!<br>\\nStudent 2: Yeah! It looks like it's getting bigger!<br>\\nTeacher: Focus on the class, kids, it's just a flower.</p>\\n<p>I feel that I am going to sneeze, I try to hold myself back and to cut the sound with my hand, but without success. I sneeze and the flower makes a sort of jump and doubles in size instantly, breaking the pot she was in. Some students laugh when they see the scene. I know I caused this. The teacher begins to get angry at so much indiscipline from the 17 and 18-year-olds.</p>\\n<p>Professor: That's enough! What's the matter with you! You're usually calm.</p>\\n<p>The professor seems quite exasperated. I take my things quickly.</p>\\n<p>Gaïa: I don't feel very well, I'll go to the infirmary...</p>\\n<p>The teacher doesn't have time to say that I'm already out of class. The teacher keeps trying to control the class, but I run to the bathroom. I lock myself in one of the booths and look at myself in my pocket mirror.</p>\\n<p>Gaia: What's the matter, big girl? Where do I get this from? How can I control that? I have to find a way to control myself.</p>\\n<p>I hear someone coming into the bathroom. I shut up and close my eyes. I have tingling in my fingertips; I clench my fists and try to breathe. I open my eyes again and look at my hands. My nails are now leaf green. I just got out of the bathroom and go wash my hands. The girl who had entered the cabin next to mine also comes out and washes her hands next to me. She gives me a little embarrassed smile, I give her the same embarrassed smile and get out of the toilet. It's rare a girl with such blond hair and several tattoos on her arms, I don't think I've seen her before.</p>\\n<p>I look at the time, the first class is almost over, but before I go to the second class, I have to learn to master this kind of skill. I'm going to sit in front of the inner garden, but I'm not going in. I look at my hands, it looks like I have varnish on my fingers. Normally, I would have been happy to have such a beautiful green varnish, but not at this time. Then I look at the tree and concentrate to grow a leaf. I see the leaf growing and growing to the size of the others. I sigh slowly, I think I've succeeded. I smile and look at a flower that has not yet reached its maximum size. I concentrate on this flower and it grows a little, and more, until it gradually reaches its size and hatches. I smile and bite my lip. I really think I control my power.</p>\\n<p>The bell rings, the first class ends. I have 15 minutes before the second class starts.</p>\"}},\"chapitreAvant\":\"chapter-1-spores\",\"chapitreApres\":\"chapter-3-new-friend\",\"nomRoman\":\"power-of-nature\",\"slug\":\"chapter-2-disruptions-in-class\",\"codeChapitre\":\"H0006C002\",\"equivalentUrl\":\"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-2-perturbations-en-classe\"}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"chapter-2-disruptions-in-class\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---en-stories-chapter-chapter-2-disruptions-in-class-ebcba9004d581f3090ac.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"contentfulChapitre\":{\"titreChapitre\":\"Chapter 2 - Disruptions in class\",\"texte\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>When I woke up, I noticed that my flower had grown a lot during the night.
