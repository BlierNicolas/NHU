The image blurred and the image of a star appeared.</p>\\n<p>\\\"If you want to survive, get that star tattooed on the back of your left hand.</p>\\n<p>And the image returns to normal after a few seconds.</p>\\n<p>Clara: What was that?<br>\\nWamien: I don't know, but they're getting on my nerves.<br>\\nClara: I can see it, honey, you're crushing the metal plate with your hand.</p>\\n<p>I look at my hand and sigh and let go of the plate. I had it all wrinkled.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: I need to reach Darakei.<br>\\nClara: All right, I'll go see the other members of the group and see what they can do to locate these monsters.</p>\\n<p>Clara gets up, puts on her jacket and leaves the house. I'll contact Darakei.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: Hi Wamien, I presume you just saw the message from the Legion.<br>\\nWamien: So we're not the only ones who got that message. You think we can locate where it came from?<br>\\nDarakei: No, the message should have lasted longer.<br>\\nWamien: How do you think they do that?<br>\\nDarakei: I guess one of the members must have power over the electricity.<br>\\nWamien: I'm thinking about it, I could ask Bailey.<br>\\nDarakei: That's an idea.<br>\\nWamien: If not, is there any good news?<br>\\nDarakei: Did you know about the guy The Legion took with them?<br>\\nWamien: No, I don't think so.<br>\\nDarakei: Well, he got the hell out and told me where they were. Also that he knows the formula and ingredients for the inhibitor.<br>\\nWamien: You couldn't stop them, I guess.<br>\\nDarakei: No, they were gone before and they collapsed their old shelter. My mens are still searching the place for clues.<br>\\nWamien: I hope you find something.<br>\\nDarakei: And me then.<br>\\nWamien: Well, come on, I gotta go see Bailey and see what he can do to help.<br>\\nDarakei: Okay, we'll keep in touch.</p>\\n<p>We'll hang up and I'll go see Bailey. I knock on his door. He opened it, he looked half asleep.</p>\\n<p>Bailey: Yes, Chief?</p>\\n<p>He scratched his hair trying to look at me and keep his eyes open. I smile when I look at him.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: I hope I'm not bothering you, but I'm gonna need you.<br>\\nBailey: I'm listening.<br>\\nWamien: The Legion sent a message on the networks saying to get a star tattooed if you wanted to survive. We have to clear the channels to say we have to ignore his messages. And then find out where they're transmitting from.<br>\\nBailey: I understand, can I change and get a coffee to wake up?<br>\\nWamien: You got 30 minutes.<br>\\nBailey: Chief, yes, chief.</p>\\n<p>I'm going home to get ready. Bailey will start making coffee and then change his clothes. I watch TV, the message appears again and says exactly the same thing. I growl a little, they get on my nerves trying to create panic. Some guild members came to see me in a panic, they had just seen the message too. I try to reassure them by saying it was just to scare them. Sam comes in and seems to have an idea.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: I'm listening, Sam. What's your idea?<br>\\nSam: We can go around the neighbouring towns and convince them that his messages are only to frighten and that The Guild will protect them.<br>\\nWamien: That's an idea. How many cars are available?<br>\\nKameron: To my knowledge, 4, and nothing prevents trying to contact the police and other emergency services.<br>\\nWamien: If we're gonna free up the network, I need Bailey, he'll be here soon.<br>\\nSam: How can you prevent messages from appearing?<br>\\nWamien: I'll watch it with Bailey.<br>\\nKameron: If I can help too, I'm a taker.<br>\\nWamien: Get the vehicles ready, if all goes well, you leave in five minutes.</p>\\n<p>Bailey knocks at the door and goes straight in. He's coming to join us and the guys are off to get the cars ready.</p>\\n<p>Bailey: So what do I do?<br>\\nWamien: You think you can run some electrical power to try to find out where the messages are coming from?<br>\\nBailey: Um yeah, but the message has to get out long enough for me to get through the networks.<br>\\nWamien: Okay, so stay on your toes, the message seems to appear every thirty minutes.<br>\\nBailey: Perfect chief.</p>\\n<p>He smiles at me confident, I can't smile back because of my worry.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: I'm going to go record something to try to defuse the panic that may occur.</p>\\n<p>Bailey nods and settles down. I go into my office thinking about how I might say things. I sit in my chair and start talking to the camera. I introduce myself and explain The Legion's purpose, their intention to create panic and kill innocent people. I am very careful not to talk about powers because I know the public is not and will not be ready to hear things like that any time soon.</p>\\n<p>I finish the recording and go back to Bailey, he seemed to have a hard time dealing with it.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: You okay, Bailey? Is it progressing?<br>\\nBailey: No, the message doesn't last long enough...<br>\\nWamien: You know, I thought of something we could do instead.<br>\\nBailey: What is it?<br>\\nWamien: When you see that the message starts, instead of letting it scroll, you place my recording over it.<br>\\nBailey: Good idea!<br>\\nWamien: However, I have to modify the recording to explain the purpose of doing this, I have to do it right.<br>\\nBailey: I understand, quickly, the next message is in 15 minutes.<br>\\nWamien: I'll go and come back to you with this.<br>\\nBailey: Perfect boss.</p>\\n<p>I go back to my office and record the message that should come first. I'll be back 10 minutes later after I've recorded and edited everything. Bailey had prepared things for a stronger signal that would get over the Legion signal.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: Everything ready, Bailey?<br>\\nBailey: Yes sir, everything is ready.<br>\\nWamien: All right, here's the recording.</p>\\n<p>Bailey takes the flash drive and places it in the device. Everything is prepared and when the Legion signal starts Bailey activates the device and the signal jams and is replaced by my recording. I smile a little when I see my message displayed.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: Great! It's working!<br>\\nBailey: Of course! We're much stronger than them!<br>\\nWamien: Yeah, but we're gonna provoke them because of that.<br>\\nBailey: Well they come, we won't let them continue like this!<br>\\nWamien: I admire your determination, Bailey. It makes me smile again.<br>\\nBailey: Thanks, boss.<br>\\nWamien: Thanks a lot Bailey, I have to go contact Darakei to explain what I did and my plan.<br>\\nBailey: Go on, boss.</p>\\n<p>I'll contact Darakei. I go to a room where I would be alone and call Darakei back, in fact, just before I dial his number, he calls me.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: Yeah, Darakei.<br>\\nDarakei: Very good idea to spread your message over theirs.<br>\\nWamien: Thank you Darakei.<br>\\nDarakei: The diffusion seems to come from several places at once. We've located five broadcast locations, but I'm afraid there'll be more.<br>\\nWamien: You want me to send people from the Guild?<br>\\nDarakei: No, I don't have access to what's happening in other countries on the continent anyway.<br>\\nWamien: So what can we do?<br>\\nDarakei: Warn the authorities in countries where we cannot enter and cross our fingers.<br>\\nWamien: I see, if not for countries where we can travel?<br>\\nDarakei: My men are already on their way.
