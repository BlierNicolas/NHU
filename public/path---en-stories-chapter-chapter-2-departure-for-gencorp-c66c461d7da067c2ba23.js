I explained to them that a geneticist thinks he has a way to cure my back pain. Devon seems happy for me, but Helix seems a little suspicious, finding it all a little suspicious. Helix never really liked doctors and all the professions that come close, why, I don't know.</p>\n<p>I'm done packing and waiting at home. A black van parks in front of my house, on the side there is the GenCorp logo and name. Well, Darakei doesn't even dare come looking for me. A man gets out of the vehicle, the back door opens and another man comes out. I'll open the door and look at the men.</p>\n<p>Man 1: Sam Mithus?<br>\nSam: Yes it's me.<br>\nMan 2: Darakei sent us to get you.<br>\nSam: That's what I thought yes.<br>\nMan 1: Is that all your personal effects?<br>\nSam: Uh, yeah.<br>\nMan 1: Good.</p>\n<p>He takes my bags and takes them to the van. I look at my mother who didn't dare come and hold me. I reach out my arms to her and she snuggles in.</p>\n<p>My mom: Take care, sweetie.<br>\nSam: I promise, Mom.</p>\n<p>She finally lets me go and I go to GenCorp's men. I get in the car and we leave.</p>\n<p>After three hours on the road and two back blocks, we finally arrive at GenCorp's facilities. I look around, the vans were in a straight line. Some drivers are maniacs. We park and I feel the car moving a little after we have stopped, we have turned a little to the left. We get out of the car and I notice that we were on a kind of turntable, that's what makes the cars aligned. The two men escort me through the maze of corridors and scientists in scientist's sarot. They're escorting me to a cafeteria. </p>\n<p>Man 1: If you are hungry, I advise you to take something before there is nothing left to eat.<br>\nSam: Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>I'm having a bowl of fruit and a cupcake. Some scientists look at me and seem to wonder who I am and what I do here. The famous look we give to strangers, I've often done that one. I didn't think it was that intimidating. I return to my escort and we continue on our way to an unknown destination. We arrive in front of a local, Darakei's office according to what is written on the label. The first man knocks on the door twice.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Come in!</p>\n<p>The second man opens the door and lets me in first. So I go in and look at all the scientific tools and devices that are in the room.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Hello Mr. Mithus.<br>\nSam: That's my father, Mr. Mithus.<br>\nDarakei: Would you rather I call you Sam?<br>\nSam: Yes.<br>\nDarakei: No problem, sit down, I'll explain how it works here.</p>\n<p>I'm gonna sit in the chair across from his desk, pretty comfortable. Darakei tells me what's going on here and what might happen to me. Basically, they're experimenting on activating the powers of new humans. New humans, as I understand it, are humans who have a specific gene that is considered active. Darakei's job is to find ways to make genes latent, active. So, according to him, my gene is latent, so I or my children have a good chance of developing a power if we trust his theory.</p>\n<p>Darakei: So, to help your body activate your power, you will need to give yourself a shot, containing the product that will help your powers activate.<br>\nSam: What if I don't have one?<br>\nDarakei: Since your gene is latent, it may take some time before your power manifests itself.<br>\nSam: And you know what kind of powers I might have?<br>\nDarakei: Unfortunately, we are not there yet in the research.<br>\nSam: I see. What if my power is dangerous?<br>\nDarakei: We have the necessary measures so that everything goes well, don't worry.<br>\nSam: Okay...</p>\n<p>I feel stressed, I have a thousand and one questions, but I must remain calm and focused on my goal. Find and understand what's going on with my back.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Sam?<br>\nSam: Huh? I'm sorry, my head was somewhere else.<br>\nDarakei: It's nothing, I was just asking if you felt ready for your first injection or if you wanted to wait until later.<br>\nSam: Uh, yes.</p>\n<p>Darakei smiles gently, amused.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Yes what?<br>\nSam: Yes, I want the injection now.<br>\nDarakei: Okay, follow me, I'll take you to the room where we can do this.<br>\nSam: Got it.</p>\n<p>I get up, so does Darakei. We get out of his office and we go to the elevator, down two floors. We go to a local and most of the scientists stop to give a head salute to Darakei and some say a \"Hello Mr Drumel\" the kind of very formal phrase that employees take out to their bosses. Darakei gives the greeting with a smile and we arrive at a room. Darakei takes his phone and contacts two assistants, who soon arrive, they are actually cute. I greet them timidly. I'm not that shy in front of young women, but this is special.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Well, take off your sweater and lie on your stomach.</p>\n<p>He was pointing at a table and the assistants were preparing things, injections I think. I close my eyes and execute myself. I take off my shirt and my camisole and lie on the table. I wait wisely for the injections to activate my power. I take deep breaths. Darakei looks at me and smiles gently.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Everything's gonna be okay, Sam. I promise you that.<br>\nSam: Yeah... I'm a little nervous right now...</p>\n<p>Darakei waves to the assistants and both give me the shot on each arm. I close my eyes and shake a little. It didn't feel good. Darakei helps me up. I clench my teeth, my back really hurts, especially my shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>Assistant 1: Sir, look at his shoulder blades.<br>\nDarakei: Oh, that's amazing!</p>\n<p>I let out a scream to make the glass tremble and I feel my back tear, and then, no more pain, nothing. I try to turn around and notice that I have wings, real bird wings on my back. They must be a good one, 10 feet wide each. The assistant screams a little, I almost knocked her down with my wings.</p>\n<p>Sam: Oh, I'm sorry.</p>\n<p>I didn't dare move for fear of hurting anyone. Darakei had stars in his eyes, he was amazed by what had just happened. I look around me without moving too much and try to bring back my wings towards me, they return slowly to bend in my back. Darakei puts a sarot on my shoulders to hide a little and so that I avoid catching cold.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Follow me, we'll go to a bigger room.<br>\nSam: Yes, okay.</p>\n<p>I follow Darakei to a larger room, where I could spread my wings freely. I take the sarot off and spread my wings wide. I sigh and look at my wings as best I can.</p>\n<p>Darakei: If you'll allow me, Sam, I'd like to take some measures.<br>\nSam: That's really cool! I love this!<br>\nDarakei: Sam, are you listening to me?<br>\nSam: Oh, yeah, sorry. Go ahead.</p>\n<p>I stand with my back to him and Darakei measures it. He sometimes throws some \"Hm\", \"Very good\" and \"Wow\". I'm trying to figure out what he's mumbling about, but I can't. He steps back and looks at me.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Do you think you can fly or is it still too early?<br>\nSam: I don't know. I'd rather rest.<br>\nDarakei: No problem. Do you want me to take you to your room? Also, we will provide you with clothes that will go with your wings so no worries.<br>\nSam: Thank you Mr Drumel.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-1-injury",chapitreApres:"chapter-3-imprisonment",nomRoman:"the-guild-wings",slug:"chapter-2-departure-for-gencorp",codeChapitre:"H0005C002",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-2-depart-pour-gencorp"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-2-departure-for-gencorp"}}}});
