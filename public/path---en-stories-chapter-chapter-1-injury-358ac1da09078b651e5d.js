Five of us should make it. I run the three meters that separate us and leave my opponents. The impact noise of our chestplates and the power cries emitted when there is contact are vivid. I know I have to hold off my opponents as long as possible before the pass is made. I see the ball passing two metres above our heads.</p>\n<p>The wall of players comes down, the opposing team has to turn around to try to catch the player of my team who now has the ball. All our team has to do is follow him and stop the opponents from catching him. When I try to block one of the rivals, my back freezes. My teammates know exactly what's going on, but the practice continues. I have to stop and get some rest. Coach approaches, his whistle around his neck.</p>\n<p>Coach: You know, kid, pain like that, you have to be careful, usually it's your body that wants to send you a message.<br>\nSam: I know Coach, but I won't lose the scholarship because of this.<br>\nCoach: You're gonna lose a lot more than a scholarship if you don't take care of yourself. Go on, take a shower and get some rest at home. We'll see how it goes tomorrow.<br>\nSam: Okay, Coach. Thank you.</p>\n<p>I get up and walk to the dressing room, looking pitiful and undone on my face. I hear the whistle of the coach screaming to try again. I go to my locker and slowly start to remove my chestplate and then my leg guards; it's difficult with my back half blocked at the shoulder blades. After about ten minutes, I end up in the shower. My shoulder blades suddenly sting my back, as if several needles were trying to come out of my back. I put my back against the wall and try to scratch myself like a bear. If anyone sees me do this, my reputation is ruined.</p>\n<p>When the pain and itching finally ends, I can finally wash normally. By the time I finished drying off, my teammates had finished training. I dress by looking at them.</p>\n<p>Helix: Maybe another time, buddy.\nSam: I hope so.<br>\nDevon: Have you been to see the doctor?<br>\nSam: Yeah, but the scans and x-rays don't show anything abnormal. I mean, he thinks my shoulder blades are bigger than average, but it shouldn't cause pain or itching.<br>\nHelix: You know puberty changes a man!<br>\nSam: At 20, puberty is quite over, especially in terms of bone growth.<br>\nDevon: You should take a few days off.<br>\nSam: Yeah, I don't know yet.</p>\n<p>I'll finish putting on my sweater and grab my backpack.</p>\n<p>Sam: Well, see you guys tomorrow.<br>\nHelix: See you tomorrow, man!<br>\nDevon: Yeah, don't forget the chemistry paper.<br>\nSam: Shit! That's true! Well, I'll be right there.</p>\n<p>I get out of the locker room and head home. I get to the bus stop and naturally, I just missed it. The next one being in 15 minutes I sit down and wait quietly for the next bus.</p>\n<p>After about 30 minutes, I finally get home. As I open the door, I notice a pair of shoes that is unknown to me. We have a guest at home? I take my shoes off and then I walk into the kitchen, I hear a voice from a man I don't know besides my mother. I enter the kitchen and I see a man, clean pants, shirt, blond hair and tousled. Who is this guy?</p>\n<p>Sam: Mom, who is this gentleman?<br>\nMy mom: Oh, hi, sweetie, did you have a good practice?<br>\nSam: Yeah.</p>\n<p>The man gets up while replacing his shirt and turns to me. He reaches out his hand to me, then introduces himself.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Good evening Sam, my name is Darakei Drumel, geneticist at GenCorp.</p>\n<p>I refuse to shake hands, look a little suspicious. At least he's not a man who wants to buy us the house.</p>\n<p>Sam: Okay and what are you doing with us?<br>\nDarakei: I understand you have temporary back pain. I have an explanation for you.<br>\nSam: Go ahead.</p>\n<p>I cross my arms a little skeptical.</p>\n<p>Darakei: The short version? Your genes reorganized towards the end of your growth. The resulting pain is a sign that your body has changed.<br>\nSam: And what do you have to do with it.<br>\nDarakei: I am the founder of a program that monitors the kind of mutation you go through. Participants receive a compensatory amount that is paid to a relative or to themselves.<br>\nSam: And what's the catch? There's always a catch.<br>\nDarakei: You will have to live in isolation in GenCorp's lab.<br>\nSam: What do you mean? I couldn't live at home anymore?<br>\nDarakei: No, for obvious security reasons.</p>\n<p>I look at my mother, wondering if she already knew about all this. She didn't seem surprised.</p>\n<p>Sam: You okay with that, mom?<br>\nMy mother: You know sweetie, I always wanted your good, to know that you are part of the new humans fills me with joy.</p>\n<p>I sigh. I didn't know my mother would leave me with the first stranger. I clench my fists and head for my room.</p>\n<p>Darakei: $15,000 a month is the money that will be paid to you or your mother depending on your choice.<br>\nSam: You shut up and get out of my house!<br>\nMy mother: Give him time to think about it, Mr. Drumel.</p>\n<p>As I go up the stairs my back freezes, I squeeze the banister and clench my teeth.</p>\n<p>Sam: Oh no, not again...</p>\n<p>Darakei approaches, I look at him from the corner of my eye.</p>\n<p>Sam: You touch me and I kick you in the face...<br>\nDarakei: I don't want to hurt you, I just want to know where it hurts.<br>\nSam: The shoulder blades... I feel like a million needles are trying to puncture my back from the inside.<br>\nDarakei: This is the kind of mutation I am looking for, with my care and that of my team, back pain will completely disappear.</p>\n<p>My mother approaches and caresses my cheek, her smile gone.</p>\n<p>My mother: I want your good, sweetie. I wish you could start performing again in sports and in class.<br>\nSam: I don't want to become a lab rat...<br>\nDarakei: It won't be, you can contact your mother every day if you want.<br>\nSam: And my friends?<br>\nDarakei: They may not understand what is happening.<br>\nSam: Okay, but when this is over, I want to go home.<br>\nDarakei: Promise. I can pick you up tomorrow at your convenience.<br>\nSam: Okay.</p>\n<p>He slowly goes up the stairs again to my room.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:null,chapitreApres:"chapter-2-departure-for-gencorp",nomRoman:"the-guild-wings",slug:"chapter-1-injury",codeChapitre:"H0005C001",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-1-blessure"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-1-injury"}}}});
