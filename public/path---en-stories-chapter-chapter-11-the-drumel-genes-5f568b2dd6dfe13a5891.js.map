Do you know what GenCorp is all about?<br>\\nWamien : Identify New Humans or possible New Humans and allow them to unlock their powers?<br>\\nDarakei: Pretty much, but there's more to it than that. When the children are four years old, we can take a blood sample if we have the consent of the parents or guardians. So when you were four, we got a sample of your blood and we identified the potential of new human genes. So we have been watching you since the moment, without intervening directly or indirectly.<br>\\nWamien : Okay, it's a little special, but I understand the idea. Of course, locking up those who have their powers activated is not very diplomatic.<br>\\nDarakei : I know, my superiors aren't too keen on letting freshly activated people walk around in the open air.<br>\\nWamien : Wait, wait, you have superiors?<br>\\nDarakei: Yes, about ten people higher than me, but in Damonia's laboratory, I am the highest ranking person on the continent.<br>\\nWamien : All this time, I thought you were the head of GenCorp and I put most of your stock on your back. And I apologize for that.<br>\\nDarakei: It's okay, don't worry. I know what you mean. You wanted to protect others, that's a great thing, you know?<br>\\nWamien: Of course Darakei, of course I wanted to protect my friends.<br>\\nDarakei : I'm proud of what you're doing with The Guild and don't worry, we'll find a way to put the Black Eagles back behind bars.<br>\\nWamien: And The Legion which is still at large too.<br>\\nDarakei: Also. Come on, I'll let you go back with your friends, I have their samples to study.<br>\\nWamien: Okay Darakei, have a good day.<br>\\nDarakei : Thank you and enjoy your journey with La Guilde.</p>\\n<p>I get up and leave Darakei's office to join the others at the reception.</p>\\n<p>Hiro: You okay?
