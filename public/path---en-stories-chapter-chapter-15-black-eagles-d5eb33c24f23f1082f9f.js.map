It happened the day you ran away. The nurse came in to give him his sedative. He couldn't take it anymore. As soon as she walked into his room. He jumped her and suffocated her... I didn't think Tom was capable of such things... As he came out of his room two guards were facing him, having heard the sound that his assassination had produced.

I'm sorry about Tom. I didn't really know him, but he was a good person according to you.<br>\\nWamien: I just wish I'd said goodbye before.<br>\\nSam: But I do remember him.</p>\\n<p>Sam took out the famous flash drive that he had stolen and that Darakei had taken back.</p>\\n<p>Wamien: You know what's on that key.<br>\\nSam: Nope, but you seem to know.<br>\\nWamien: A version 2.0 of my armor, he had taken it for me and knew it concerned me.

Not too much, party with Clara?<br>\\nWamien: What? I was asleep, let's not be ridiculous.<br>\\nKameron: Yeah yeah, hey, I did some careful research just to reassure you.<br>\\nWamien: All right... Go ahead.<br>\\nKameron: Yesterday you said we weren't the only ones with powers, were you?<br>\\nWamien: Yes and?<br>\\nKameron: Well I found places where people, who supposedly have powers, have committed crimes or thefts.<br>\\nWamien: They basically abuse their powers.<br>\\nKameron: Yeah, and if you ask me, we should stop them.<br>\\nWamien: I agree, but not now, we should learn to become stronger first.<br>\\nKameron: And Tim smarter ahah.<br>\\nWamien: Very funny Kameron, very funny.<br>\\nKameron: Roh stop it is just a joke.
