Since there is no bus that corresponds to the route I have to take to get home, it becomes more and more difficult to return home. I try to stay on the main streets, the streets where there are more passers-by.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, I see a group of five men, dressed in the style of a violent gang, as I heard on the news. The gang was right in the middle of the sidewalk and walking towards me, they were talking and laughing, one of them was smoking because a little cloud of smoke was rising from time to time. One of the guys sees me and the way I look at them.</p>\n<p>Man 1: Yo! The kid's staring at us!<br>\nMan 2: Let's get him!</p>\n<p>The guys start running towards me. I make big eyes and turn around to find an alley. I enter in the alley and lean against a dumpster.</p>\n<p>Man 3: He turned in the alley fast!</p>\n<p>I see guys running by, right in front of me. None of them turned on me. They keep running and, at the other end of the alley, they look left, right, then they split into two groups. I wonder what happened. Why didn't they see me? I come out of hiding and notice that I'm in front of a mirror, but I can't see myself. I look at my hands, but I can't see anything. I'm invisible! I begin to become visible again gradually. I sigh with relief. I run home on my way home. I hope I don't run into those guys again. Finally, I just look like an idiot running right in the middle of the sidewalk. I finally get home. I unlock the door shaking and I come in. I close the door and breathe fast, I'm soaked in sweat. I hear my father working, his office door half-opened.</p>\n<p>Father: Good evening, son!</p>\n<p>I leave my bag in the hall and head for my room. My father comes out of his office and stares at me.</p>\n<p>Father: You all right, son? You look terrified.<br>\nJack: I got chased by a gang, I don't know how, but I lost them.<br>\nFather: Oh no... that's enough, I'll drive you to school and pick you up after school.<br>\nJack: Dad...<br>\nMy father: My son can't risk his life like that to get an education.</p>\n<p>I try to catch my breath in front of my father who is in all his states. I want to explain what I saw and how I think I lost the gang members.</p>\n<p>Jack: Dad waits.</p>\n<p>My father looks at me and seems to refrain from speaking in order to let me say what I have to say. I finally catch my breath.</p>\n<p>Jack: I managed to lose them by becoming invisible, I think.<br>\nMy father: Invisible? How?<br>\nJack: I don't know, I ran into an alley. I got up against a dumpster and then the guys walked past me and crossed the alley. But they ran in front of me without even seeing me. Then when I managed to move, I noticed that I was facing a mirror and couldn't see myself.</p>\n<p>My father scratches his head like he always does when he works and doesn't understand something.</p>\n<p>Jack: You must think I'm crazy...<br>\nMy father: Oh no! Not at all, son, if you do possess that gift, that would be great.<br>\nJack: Great, how?<br>\nMy father: I found books that deal with possible evolutions that could take place in the generations to come. This book is about a thousand years old.<br>\nJack: Evolutions? You mean the DNA is changing or something?<br>\nMy father: Exactly. Follow me, I'll show you the books in question.</p>\n<p>My belly gurgled, supper time approaching.</p>\n<p>Jack: Can we have dinner first?<br>\nFather: Oh, I forgot to make dinner.<br>\nJack: Dad... well then, we'll cook a simple dish.</p>\n<p>So I'm gonna make a simple meal for me and my dad. My father had tabled some documents on the subject of people with powers.</p>\n<p>Father: So if you have a power, it means there's a way to provoke it.<br>\nJack: Yes, but I don't know how.<br>\nFather: How did you feel when the gang was after you?<br>\nJack: I was afraid for my life.<br>\nMy father: Do you think you can recreate this feeling?<br>\nJack: I don't know, and I don't want to go through that again, much less at this hour.<br>\nFather: It's okay, maybe there are other ways you can use without fear.<br>\nJack: Thanks Dad.</p>\n<p>I get up, rinse my plate at the sink and then I go to my room. My father is probably going back to his office to continue his research. I'm thinking about this; do I really have powers? Why do I have it, if I do? Since when do I get to do that? I know I have to find a more normal way to use my power. I'll stand in front of my mirror and try to reproduce the phenomenon. I close my eyes and concentrate. I breathe in and out to control my heart rate. I open my eyes and I still see myself. I sigh, after all, a city is not built in a day. I close my eyes and try to relive the feeling I had while the guys were chasing me. I clench my fists and focus on emotion. When I feel emotional, I open my eyes again and notice that I am still very visible.</p>\n<p>Jack: But!</p>\n<p>I keep my fists clenched, fatigue doesn't help me concentrate. I sit on my bed and sighs. I close my eyes and think about it. What was my intention when I went into the alley? Probably hide. Maybe if I can focus on that, I can.</p>\n<p>Jack: Come on, I'll try again.</p>\n<p>I stand up and stand in front of my mirror. I close my eyes and try to reproduce the intention to hide and feel safe. I feel something happening inside me. Am I on the right track or is it something psychological? I open my eyes slowly and notice that I am a little transparent, but not completely invisible. I did it, almost. I continue the exercise and manage to make myself completely invisible. I try to move, while keeping the same concentration. I see I'm losing a little of my invisible appearance.</p>\n<p>Jack: Dad! Come here!</p>\n<p>My father arrives a few seconds later, he opens the door and his mouth opens with amazement.</p>\n<p>My dad: Wow! My son! I'm so proud of you!</p>\n<p>He's coming to hold me. I lose my concentration and become visible again.</p>\n<p>Jack: I can't move without losing my invisibility and I have to focus on a sense of security.<br>\nMy father: It's okay, son, you'll train and become more skilled with your power.</p>\n<p>My father lets me go slowly and almost cries.</p>\n<p>Jack: Come on, Dad! Don't cry about it.<br>\nFather: I'm not crying, I'm touched.<br>\nJack: I have to do my homework now.<br>\nMy dad: Okay, son.</p>\n<p>My father leaves my room and gently closes the door. I sit in my chair and notice that I left my bag in the hall. So I'll go get him. I go back to my room and get back in my chair before I start doing my homework.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:null,chapitreApres:"chapter-2-let-the-training-begin",nomRoman:"the-invisible-defender",slug:"chapter-1-chase-race",codeChapitre:"H0008C001",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-1-course-poursuite"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-1-chase-race"}}}});
