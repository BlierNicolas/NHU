Coming back from the job I found in a company, I notice a strange man. I stop and watch in silence. He had an apple in his hand and closed his eyes, as if concentrating. And suddenly a second apple forms in the palm of his other hand. Is it a power or just a magic trick? It may not be the best of my ideas, but I need to know if what he did was a magic trick or actually a power. So I approach him and put my hand on the chair in front of him.</p>\n<p>Daryl: Hi, can I sit down?\nMan: Sure, go ahead.\nDaryl: So my name is Daryl Koido.\nMan: Well, nice to meet you Daryl, my name is Vincent Ortiz.\nDaryl: I saw your magic trick about that apple. That's really interesting, where'd you hide it?\nVincent: I... I don't know what you mean.\nDaryl: You know, if it's not a magic trick, you can tell me. I am in your case.\nVincent: Hm, hm. I'm not sure I can be sure I believe you.\nDaryl: I can control gravity.\nVincent: I've had enough, I don't want to be bothered.</p>\n<p>Vincent starts to get up and takes his coat.</p>\n<p>Daryl: Vincent, wait a minute.</p>\n<p>Vincent turns around.</p>\n<p>Vincent: Hm?\nDaryl: Are you afraid of new humans?\nVincent: So that's what they call us.\nDaryl: Yes.\nVincent: No, I just don't intend to talk about it.\nDaryl: I'm sorry in this case, I didn't mean to offend you with my question earlier. Actually, it's nice to meet someone like me.\nVincent: Yeah, we'll see later. When we are driven out and threatened by the authorities of the continent.\nDaryl: I know some people in government who are on our side, can we at least exchange contact information, if you need to talk about that, I'll be there.\nVincent: Well, all right...</p>\n<p>Vincent is pointing his phone at me. I take it and enter my details and I send myself a message to get Vincent's number before deleting the message. That way, if he takes me off his contacts, I still get his number. I give it back with a smile. He makes a smile a little embarrassed and leaves. Since it's getting late, I think I should go home. What I did, I crossed the city and finally arrived home. I put my bag on the chair at the entrance and take off my shoes.</p>\n<p>Daryl: Well, let's see if my program was able to find any new humans while I was away.</p>\n<p>I go to my computer and look at the list that should have filled up if he found any new humans I could recruit. Empty, still today. One day, I'm gonna be able to locate some new humans. Already, I'm surprised I didn't locate this Vincent Ortiz earlier.</p>\n<p>I turn on the radio on the news channel. The classic story of domotressian spies located in Hutlia and Hutlian spies located in Domotress. They'll end up starting a war between each other. Then, the announcement of the few murders that occurred during the night. I don't want to let this go on, but there's nothing I can do if I'm alone on this idea. That's why I'm looking for new humans.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>On Vincent's side, he'd come home thinking about Daryl. Maybe he could contact him again tomorrow. As he walks by the side of an alley, he hears voices and a garbage can overturn. He hesitated for a moment between going to see what was happening or simply continuing his journey. Vincent clenched his fist and decided to go. The voices were getting louder, it was probably one of the city's gangs. Vincent hid behind a container trying to see a little further. He saw two people, a big fellow with the size of an ice cabinet and another man as tall, but this one was much thinner in front of a man on his knees looking down at the ground. I get out my phone and take a picture and send it to the first contact I see, Daryl's. While I was texting, the two people started beating the other man. They said nothing and the man took the blows in silence. I get up and leave this place to go home.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I see Vincent's text. Why did he send me that picture. I send him a message: \"Can I have an explanation about this picture?\". Vincent does not take long to answer: \"It is two members of one of the gangs of the city, I believe that they beat the man to death. If you want to do something to change the way society will see New Humans. Start by dismantling these gangs.\" I risk asking him again, \"Would you help me?\" I was a little suspicious of Vincent's answer, a pretty \"no\" and Vincent replied: \"I'll think about it, but I'm not saying yes\". I smile, it wasn't a no, either. Maybe I'll be able to ally myself against these groups. I replied: \"Send this photo anonymously to the officers. Maybe they can do something faster than us.</p>\n<p>Vincent sent the picture to the police with directions to the alley where it happened.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:null,chapitreApres:"chapter-2-recruitment",nomRoman:"the-red-ravens",slug:"chapter-1-an-unlikely-meeting",codeChapitre:"H0003C001",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-1-une-rencontre-improbable"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-1-an-unlikely-meeting"}}}});
