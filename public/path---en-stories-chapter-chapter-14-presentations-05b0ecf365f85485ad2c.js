I enter last, Clara had entered first and guided people to the living room where everyone will be able to settle. People will sit down, Tiana next to Sam who prefers to stand because of her wings. Everyone sits in silence.</p>\n<p>I'm going to the center of the room.</p>\n<p>Wamien: So, hi everyone. My name is Wamien and I am happy to see you all in perfect health. Just so we know each other better, I'd like us to make the introductions. Like I said, my name is Wamien and what's special about me is that I have a connection to all electronic devices and I'm a cyborg.</p>\n<p>Some people make \"oh\" surprises, which makes me smile softly. I look at Clara giving her a little sign to introduce herself too.</p>\n<p>Clara: Hello, hello, hello. My name is Clara and I am able to regenerate myself if I get hurt, as well as heal people if they get hurt.<br>\nTiana: Hi, I'm Tiana and I'm flexible, so my body doesn't have the limitations that humans have.</p>\n<p>She demonstrates by rotating her arm in several directions, which is impossible for humans to do.</p>\n<p>Sam: Yo me I am Sam, as you can see, I have angel wings on my back, which means I can fly.<br>\nA young man with glasses speaks: Hi, I am Kameron, I am able to generate fire from any part of my body.<br>\nA woman speaks: Hello to everything, my name is Thalie and I know how to turn my body into indestructible glue.<br>\nA young man about 17 years old speaks: Hi hello, I am Alexis and I can do telekinesis.<br>\nThe boy next to him speaks: I am Bailey and I am able to control and create electricity.<br>\nTim: I'm Tim and I'm super strong, as well as having skin that can't hurt itself.<br>\nA girl who had remained silent all along the journey speaks: I am Kémyanne, but you can call me Kémy, I know how to pass through the walls.<br>\nA young woman a little more smiling takes the floor: I am Louann, but you can also call me Lou or the Water Fairy because I know how to handle water and make it change state.<br>\nA girl had stayed on the edge of the wall, a little behind. She speaks last: Pff your powers are nothing compared to me, I am Saeko the vampire! I am super fast, I can fly by will and I am very strong.<br>\nWamien: All right, everybody, and we'll stay here for a while and see how we can exploit our powers to their fullest. Except Clara, we had all the powers through science. Despite everything, if we managed to stay alive, it was simply because our genes were designed to work.<br>\nTiana: So it's as if the fact that we were test subjects had anticipated the appearance of our powers?<br>\nWamien: Yes, our children would have been more likely to have powers.<br>\nSam: And Clara is that example.<br>\nClara: Yeah, if you can put it that way.<br>\nSaeko: Pff, kids, it's just for crying and filling diapers.<br>\nClara: Hey oh, a little respect please.<br>\nSaeko: Why? I'm the kind of girl who does her thing solo.<br>\nWamien: Well, you're gonna have to get used to staying in a group because we have to stay together as discreet as possible.<br>\nSam: Like, am I gonna have to avoid going out?<br>\nWamien: At least to go to places with too many people.<br>\nSam: Um, I see.<br>\nTim: What about me?<br>\nWamien: You should be fine, you almost look like a muscle man with your build.</p>\n<p>Some laughs are heard, which makes me smile. Tim doesn't answer the joke and gets up suddenly.</p>\n<p>Tim: I'm hungry!</p>\n<p>I turn slowly to Clara</p>\n<p>Wamien: Shall we get some pizza?<br>\nClara: Okay, I'm leaving with Alexis and Kameron. You guys are coming.<br>\nAlexis: Of course! I can't say no to pizza!</p>\n<p>Before they leave, they make a list of the kinds of pizza everyone wants and all three leave. Tiana and Sam go into the kitchen and set the table for all of us. I'll go upstairs and make a quick plan of the rooms.</p>\n<p>I stay to talk with the others and reassure those who remained a little worried to know what we will become all. A good half hour later. Clara, Alexis and Kameron come back with the pizza boxes. Everyone comes to the table and we eat with appetite. Saeko remains in front of his plate and his slice of pepperoni pizza cheese. I look at her passive.</p>\n<p>Wamien: You're not eating?<br>\nSaeko: Sparrow's appetite and then I like blood better.</p>\n<p>Some people look at her as if she had no place among us, which is completely false.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Nobody's forcing you to eat, but don't try to drink our blood, will you?<br>\nSaeko: It should be okay, nobody has enough good blood for me here.</p>\n<p>She gets up and goes upstairs.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-13-rebellion-part-2",chapitreApres:"chapter-15-black-eagles",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-1",slug:"chapter-14-presentations",codeChapitre:"H0001C015",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-14-les-presentations"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-14-presentations"}}}});
