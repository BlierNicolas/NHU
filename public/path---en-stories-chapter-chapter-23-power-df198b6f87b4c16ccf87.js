I look at my friends and they look at me with big eyes and see that I could move. I signal them to shut up and go back to Bruno. I concentrate on the screens and tell them to blur.</p>\n<p>Bruno: Come on, shitty cameras.</p>\n<p>He's hitting the screens. I stare at him and start sending a buzzing towards him. We see him scrubbing his ears. I smile a little when I see this, then I concentrate on the doors and make them open. The guards shout surprises and place their weapons in the direction of the doors.</p>\n<p>Wamien: You didn't block the doors?<br>\nBruno: What do you say, veggie?<br>\nWamien: The veggie asks if you've blocked the doors.</p>\n<p>Bruno approaches and takes me by the collar.</p>\n<p>Bruno: You may be a vegetable right now, but I wouldn't stop you from getting a good one in your face.</p>\n<p>Immediately it is Bruno who takes one of them, he moves back and looks around him by placing his hand on his cheek.</p>\n<p>Bruno: Who did this?</p>\n<p>I place my eyes in infrared to check what I thought. Éléa, that's her. That's the agent Darakei sent to get us out of here.</p>\n<p>Éléa approaches Bruno a little and hits him in the stomach. He leans a little pushing a short groan of pain. Éléa takes him by the top of the sweater and sends him into a wall.</p>\n<p>The guards look at the scene, some step back and others run away in fear. Bruno takes out a gun and points it at where it was.</p>\n<p>Éléa approaches me.</p>\n<p>Wamien: I'm fine, take care of the guards.</p>\n<p>Éléa smiles a little, goes towards two guards and starts by hitting one in the face. He retreats and the second flees with the last guards of the room. Éléa takes the first guard by the collar and sends it through the door frame. I'm taking this opportunity to have the doors locked. Bruno finds himself alone with about twenty mutants. I deactivate my friends' masks and get up breaking the chains as if nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>Bruno looks at the scene with fear and points his gun at me.</p>\n<p>Bruno: Freeze!</p>\n<p>I turn slowly to him and Éléa goes to him. She hits him so hard in the face that he faints. Éléa becomes visible again, those who know her are happy to see her and the others look at her a little surprised.</p>\n<p>Éléa: Come on, let's get out of here.</p>\n<p>Tim gets his muscles back and Sam gets his wings back. Release all my friends and get behind the cameras. They're armed and ready to fire.</p>\n<p>Wamien: They're armed outside the doors, it's going to be hard to get out of here.<br>\nÉléa: Oh, believe me, It will be fine.</p>\n<p>She takes out her cell phone, takes a picture and calls someone.</p>\n<p>Éléa: You can come, I'll send you the picture.</p>\n<p>I don't have time to see who she's contacting. She's hanging up. Darakei appears where Éléa took the picture. Everyone looks at him with big eyes surprised to see someone appear.</p>\n<p>Darakei: I can teleport just three at a time.<br>\nWamien: From... since when do you have powers?<br>\nDarakei: Since I was 16, I would explain once I got out of here with everyone. I'll beam us to the lab.</p>\n<p>I remain a little suspicious, I look at Éléa who smiles a little happy to see that I am safe.</p>\n<p>Wamien: I come first, Clara and Sam you come with us.</p>\n<p>We form a circle and beam into a room in the lab.</p>\n<p>Darakei: I'll get the others.<br>\nWamien: Okay. All right.</p>\n<p>He disappears and soon returns with all the others.</p>\n<p>Darakei: So I've had the power to teleport since I was 16...</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-22-intervention-part-2",chapitreApres:"chapter-24-the-story",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-1",slug:"chapter-23-power",codeChapitre:"H0001C025",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-23-le-pouvoir"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-23-power"}}}});
