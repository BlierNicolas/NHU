It's Wamien. I-I hope you remember me.<br>\nClara: Of course! How could I forget someone like you.</p>\n<p>I hear him laughing, I smile a little.</p>\n<p>Wamien: I am in the kingdom of Mahinu. You can pick me up near the border.<br>\nClara: Uh, sure, do you look worried?<br>\nWamien: I don't have much time to talk on the phone, I'll be on the terrace of a café that has hibiscus flowerpots, okay?<br>\nClara: Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can.<br>\nWamien: Thank you.</p>\n<p>I'm gonna hang up and move into the café I described to Clara. I wait, I watch the cars go by, the stress rises every time a car that looks like Clara's passes in the street. Time passes, 30 minutes later, Clara's car arrives. I'll go and get in the car.</p>\n<p>Clara: Hi.<br>\nWamien: Hi, thank you very much. I Heum, I know it's fast, but can you put me up with you for a while?<br>\nClara: Uh, yeah, I have a guest room, you can stay as long as you want.</p>\n<p>She gave me one of those smiles, enough to make all men melt. I give her the same sweet smile and she sets off for home.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Clara opens her apartment door and we go in.</p>\n<p>Clara: Welcome to my house, I'll start by showing you around your room.<br>\nWamien: I'm right behind you.</p>\n<p>Clara walked towards a room and opened the door, there was a bed, a bedside table and a wardrobe to store clothes, the bare minimum.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Thank you so much, Clara.<br>\nClara: I'll show you the rest of the house.</p>\n<p>Clara shows me the kitchen, where the stuff is stored, the living room, the bathroom, how it works for washing and she shows me her bedroom door.</p>\n<p>Clara: This is my room, but it's a little messy so I'll avoid opening the door.<br>\nWamien: I see, it's okay. </p>\n<p>I smile at her. I'm glad to see someone's here for me.</p>\n<p>Clara: I'll have to go to work though.<br>\nWamien: Where do you work? You think I could come?<br>\nClara: I work in a hospital so I don't really think you're gonna be able to come and find stuff to do. You'd better stay here. There's plenty of food in the pantry. You've got muscles, you must eat a lot.</p>\n<p>I laugh, I love her humor.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Heum agree no problem. </p>\n<p>Clara slowly approaches and comes to give me a kiss on the cheek. I blush like a tomato, a little surprised. She laughs and goes to get her bag.</p>\n<p>Clara: Well go bye bye, don't answer the phone or the door, okay?<br>\nWamien: Okay, what time do you think you'll be back?<br>\nClara: 18 o'clock.<br>\nWamien: Okay, work hard.<br>\nClara: As always.</p>\n<p>She took her bag and left the house. Leaving me there alone. I'm going to watch TV. It's been a long time since I've heard the news. There wasn't much interesting stuff to listen to on TV. I was a little hungry so I went to watch what there was to find chips I was eating while watching TV. I wonder if she knows I'm not 100% human and especially if she would let me stay with her. My biggest fear would be that she would warn the kingdom authorities and that Darakei would know where I am. I'd better shut up about who I am.</p>\n<p>Around 18:05, the door of Clara's house opens slowly.</p>\n<p>Clara: Wamien? I'm home now.<br>\nWamien: Hi Clara.<br>\nClara: Have you had dinner? I brought some food.<br>\nWamien: No, I haven't had dinner.<br>\nClara: Aren't you hungry?<br>\nWamien: I wanted to wait for you.</p>\n<p>I joined her in the kitchen and she had set the table for a meal. Kind of like a one-on-one meal. She sat down.</p>\n<p>Clara: You coming?<br>\nWamien: Yes.</p>\n<p>I smile and sit in front of her. We eat and talk together for a while. A little after dinner, Clara goes to take a shower and lets me do the dishes. After careful consideration, I'll tell her tomorrow what I am and explain to her what I was running away from by calling her that during the day. I hope she understands my situation. I mean, if she gets scared, I'll go to another kingdom. Clara comes out of the shower with a towel around her hiding her body from breast to knees.</p>\n<p>Clara: I'm tired. I'm gonna go to sleep. Good night, Wamien, get some rest.<br>\nWamien: Thanks too, Clara.</p>\n<p>I try not to blush too much to see her come to me in that outfit. She laughed softly and went to her room. I go into mine and take off my shirt, shoes and socks, staying in jogging pants to lie down and look at the ceiling. I'm falling asleep slowly.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-10-elea",chapitreApres:"chapter-12-truth",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-1",slug:"chapter-11-the-new-house",codeChapitre:"H0001C011",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-11-la-nouvelle-maison"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-11-the-new-house"}}}});
