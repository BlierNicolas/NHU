It was about 6 in the morning and no one was in GenCorp's office, well, that's what he thought. A young woman was monitoring his activities through surveillance cameras. She could finally move now that he was settled. Darakei had no idea he was in the labs. He was starting to work on the inhibitor. She went through the labs without any problems. She was hoping to reach the server room in five minutes. She arrived at a door that refused to open.</p>\\n<p>Thief: Hm...</p>\\n<p>The young woman starts hacking into the system, trying to be discreet in the monitoring. She saw a small module that detected the opening of the cases, she had to hurry, less than 30 seconds to hack the card reader. She got there within 3 seconds and entered. The corridor was dark, the lights must have gone out. Darakei got up and went to the toilet, a path that passed close to that of the intruder. She went to the bottom without opening the light. There was no lock on the door that was in his way. Darakei would go to the bathroom with his hands in his pockets and think about the inhibitor. She crossed a corridor, then heard footsteps. She looked subtly. Darakei was passing by, he was on the other side of the door. He continued his journey without even feeling the presence of the young woman. She waited for him to pass hiding in an intersection and sighed with relief. She heard a door open and close a few seconds later, Darakei had just entered the toilet. She quickly made her way to the server room crossing the corridor in a hurry. There was a glass door and a lock.</p>\\n<p>Thief: Hm... </p>\\n<p>She squatted down and pulled out her tools. She reached the door and entered, taking care to close the door. Darakei looked at his bracelet, the silent alarm on the door had just gone on. He sent a message to his guards and went to see what was happening. The thief plugged her mini computer into the console and began the search for the list. She found it quickly, Darakei was coming. She download it. She had to enter a multi-character password. She started a password decryption program. Darakei entered the room and blocked the door. It would not open without Darakei's password, which used two passwords to open the door. She let him run as she leaned against the table.</p>\\n<p>Thief: I really need a raise...</p>\\n<p>Darakei heard the young woman's voice and walked along without making any noises. He had taken a stick to knock out the intruder if necessary. The young woman looked at the screen. It was almost over, fortunately for her. She saw a few glitches on the screen, something was happening. Darakei came and saw her, he was behind her. He was going to teleport and immobilize her. She moved at the last minute. Darakei hid, he made a little twitch that the thief had clearly heard. She turned towards him, pointing her gun directly between his eyes. Darakei put his hands up.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: Oh, calm down!</p>\\n<p>She frowned. </p>\\n<p>Thief: I would have thought something less harmless.</p>\\n<p>He disappeared suddenly. She put her gun away and returned to her password. He appeared behind her and tackled her on the ground.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: What is your name and why are you here?!</p>\\n<p>She unlocks herself when she manages to kick him and pulls out her weapon. Darakei backed off and disappeared. He stood against a server little further away.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: You can't get out of here!<br>\\nThief: Implying that I need to get out. </p>\\n<p>She found the passwords and sent the list to her boss. Darakei took the opportunity to hit her in the back at the spine. She clenched her teeth and fell on her knee to the ground. </p>\\n<p>Thief: Okay, now I've had enough. </p>\\n<p>She turned around and pulled out her rifle again. He hit her on the wrist to make her drop the gun. She dropped him and kicked him in the face. Darakei ended up on his back and had a nosebleed. He groaned in pain.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: Fuck! It hurts!</p>\\n<p>She took her computer and knocked on the glass door which shattered. She heard footsteps approaching her. She had a few seconds to get the hell out. She runs straight to the path she had taken. A car was parked right in front of her. She went to her motorcycle. The car went to follow her. The other guards also arrived for the pursuit. She started her bike and left in a hurry. A car passed by her and one of the guards pulled out his gun and was going to shoot the rear tyre of the motorcycle. She accelerated, passing them at high speed. She even passed between the cars. There were two cars chasing her. Darakei stood up slowly and looked at what she had done. He understood that she had sent the list to an external server. They sent a message that they could capture her dead or alive. The young woman lost them after a good hour of driving. They lost her in the middle of the traffic. Darakei was angry, he couldn't understand why everything fell on him at once. He let one of his assistants clean his nose and apply a pain cream.</p>\\n<p>Darakei: What did I do to have such a crappy night?<br>\\nAssistant: I don't know, Mr. Drumel....<br>\\nDarakei: It was not a question where I needed an answer Aïsha...<br>\\nAïsha: Oh... I put the cream, it will be cold.</p>\\n<p>The assistant put on the cream and Darakei make a funny face, the cream was indeed very cold.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Julius and his men had settled well and had planned several bases throughout the city. Cedric tried to meditate to better understand his power, he managed to make some kind of energy filaments appear and to control them. Shelley was reading in her corner, she had realized that she had an infinite memory. Albert looked at everyone and saw a kind of bluish aura emanating from each of them, as well as from himself, he had the power to detect powers, little useful according to him. Julius enters the room, all rise in the moment and stand at attention. Julius smiled and laughed gently.</p>\\n<p>Julius: At ease! I have a mission for the three of you. You are going to walk around town and if Albert sees someone with an aura like us, you should have as much information as possible about them. Name, address, family, phone, that sort of thing.<br>\\nCedric, Albert and Shelley shout at each other: Chief! Yes! Chief!<br>\\nCedric: Could we offer them free wishes?<br>\\nShelley: A draw? We offer them a draw where they can win a free wish? That would impose a first name, phone number or email address.<br>\\nJulius: I don't care how you do it, I want a list with names.</p>\\n<p>Julius went to the door. Cedric waited for him to leave.</p>\\n<p>Cedric: It's either me or he's been under a lot of stress lately. We're comfortable, we have several alternate plans. I don't see what he' s worried about.<br>\\nAlbert: Who knows, anyway, we can't really go against his ideas.<br>\\nShelley: And then it's thanks to him so we have powers. It's not like we don't owe him anything...<br>\\nCedric: Right, well, let's get everything ready and go.</p>\\n<p>The small team prepares the false print.</p>\\n<p>On Billy's side, who had gone to buy food, arrives at the cash register and smells his body in a strange way. It starts to grow and take on even more muscle. He started screaming, the pain was horrible, his shirt was torn and his shoes broke. The cashier starts screaming as she backs away to try to escape. Billy keeps growing and the rest of his clothes tear. Billy breaks the grocery window and gets out. He kept growing and getting stronger. His body stopped growing, he was now 4 meters tall and practically a ton of muscle. Civilians were fleeing and the bravest were taking pictures. Billy would catch his breath trying to get used to his new morphology. He got up slowly, people backed away. He looks up at them, the police sirens are heard. He looked where the sirens were coming from and started running in the other direction. He didn't want to get caught. He had no choice but to hide in the forest. He continued to sink into the forest even though he knew the police wouldn't risk it, and he still had to try to find something to cover himself.</p>\\n<p>Celia was watching the news on TV, it talked about the tensions between Abaltia and Giotry, nothing new, these countries have been in conflict for more than 40 years, Giotry has a problem of overpopulation and the other refuses to let the inhabitants who can afford it to relocate. Celia closed her eyes and frowned, she had a cramp in her stomach. She opened her eyes and found herself face to face with herself. The one who was standing is backing up, surprised.</p>\\n<p>Celia: How did I do that?<br>\\nCelia sadist: I don't know! Anyway, it would be more fun if we could see some bloody fighting scenes, we have movies here?</p>\\n<p>The Celia who was standing takes the remote control and changes position until she comes across a gory horror movie.</p>\\n<p>Celia sadist: Ah! Finally something interesting!<br>\\nCelia: I'll go to the chief and tell him about my power.<br>\\nCelia sadist: Yeah, whatever.</p>\\n<p>Celia sadist went to sit down while the other Celia gets up and joins Julius.</p>\\n<p>Celia: Chief! Chief! I found my power! </p>\\n<p>Julius looked at Celia a little surprised, she was the last one who had not yet shown any powers.</p>\\n<p>Julius: Interesting, what is it?<br>\\nCelia: I can duplicate myself!<br>\\nJulius: Interesting, can you duplicate yourself now?<br>\\nCelia: Um, I don't know, I'll try.</p>\\n<p>Celia closed her eyes and tried to do what had happened to her again. Julius looked, Celia sighed after a few seconds.</p>\\n<p>Celia: I can't do it, the one I managed to do is this way, chief.</p>\\n<p>Celia went to the living room. Julius put what he had in his hands and followed her. The sadistic Celia smiled as she bit her lip. She laughed a little when someone got killed. Julius looked at her for a moment.</p>\\n<p>Julius: It doesn't seem to be just your double, but she seems to have a different personality.<br>\\nCelia: I don't understand...<br>\\nJulius: Look how she's sitting on the couch, can you see that she doesn't have the same posture as you?</p>\\n<p>Celia sadist was actually slumped on the couch, she took up a lot of space.

Julius steps back a little bit from Celia and sees another Celia coming out of her.</p>\\n<p>Julius: Okay.</p>\\n<p>The three Celia look at each other, the Celia sadist smiles.</p>\\n<p>Celia sadist: Cool! Another Celia in the family!</p>\\n<p>The new Celia looks at Julius and bow gently.</p>\\n<p>Julius: What are you doing?<br>\\nNew Celia: My apologies!
