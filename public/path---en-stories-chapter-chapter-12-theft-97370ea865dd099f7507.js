Darakei got to the lab in a hurry and there was a lot of damage. A guard arrives with a tape of the surveillance cameras.</p>\n<p>Guard: Mr. Drumel, we think we know who did the theft.<br>\nDarakei: Let me see, please.</p>\n<p>The guard gives the recording to Darakei and he watches the recording. We could see very clearly Julius hacking and taking all the research that Darakei had done to try to isolate genes from New Humans.</p>\n<p>Darakei: Oh shit... He stole all the research...<br>\nGuard: Do you want us to send guards to his house?<br>\nDarakei: Do it now! We can't let Julius keep my research with him!</p>\n<p>The guard bowed and left directly with several guards.</p>\n<p>Darakei : Like if we needed that...</p>\n<p>On Julius' side, he had taken refuge at the meeting point he had defined with his accomplices, a sort of military bunker. The perfect place for him to try using the test samples to create New Humans. Julius had recruited a dozen soldiers who wanted to participate in the experiment. Julius had promised them power and a nice amount of money in case the experiment failed. Julius is going to see the soldiers.</p>\n<p>Julius: So! Who wants to try first?<br>\nJake: Come on Julius, I can't wait to get my power.<br>\nJulius: All right, here's a dose. However, the power can take between 15 and 20 minutes to manifest itself.<br>\nJake: Got it.</p>\n<p>Julius approaches in the direction of Jake with the dose to administer and stings Jake who freezes a little.</p>\n<p>Julius: You okay, Jake?<br>\nJake: Y-yes.</p>\n<p>Jake sat on the floor and tried to breathe as best he could. A soldier is approaching Jake, Debbie.</p>\n<p>Debbie: Jake, you gonna be okay?<br>\nJake: Yes, simple dizziness will pass.<br>\nDebbie: It's my turn, Julius.<br>\nJulius: Perfect.</p>\n<p>Julius injects the product on all the soldiers and finally on himself. Jake looks at Jennifer and suddenly Jake's hair turns red like Jennifer's, everyone who notices him is surprised.</p>\n<p>Jennifer: Oh! But you have the power to copy others, Jake!<br>\nJake: Huh? What are you talking about?<br>\nBrett: You have the same hair color as her.<br>\nJake: Really? Anybody got a mirror?</p>\n<p>Celia, another one of the soldiers stands up. She will take her bag to search inside and take out a mirror before returning to Jake who had regained her natural hair color. Jake looks in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Jake: But not at all?<br>\nJennifer: I'm telling you, you had red hair.</p>\n<p>Jake closes his eyes and changes the color of his hair, again like Jennifer's and looks in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Jake: Well, I have a power!</p>\n<p>Soldiers notice their powers one after the other. Debbie doesn't need oxygen anymore to breathe. Brett has reptile-related abilities. Jennifer can teleport short distances. Russell is capable of hypnotizing any human being. Luke is able to predict the future over a few hours, Rebecca is able to alter her cells. Albert is able to detect people with and without power. Shelley has an unlimited memory. Cedric has powers that can be described as magical. And finally, Julius has impenetrable skin. Celia and Billy haven't noticed any changes yet that might indicate a power.</p>\n<p>Julius: All right, I got us plane tickets to another continent.<br>\nDebbie: We have to get out of here?<br>\nJulius: Yes, we go to Wembet on the continent of Xentil.<br>\nBrett: Why there? It's a shit country.<br>\nJulius: That's where I bought a building where we can live. Come on, everybody get their stuff back, we leave in a few hours.</p>\n<p>Everyone gets up and prepares for the start, some reluctantly. The journey went off without any problems, Julius had planned everything and had managed to get through customs without the guards recognizing him and the dozen soldiers accompanying him.</p>\n<p>Debbie and Jennifer leave for their side when they arrive to pick up some local clothes for herself and the others. Julius had been very clear about this, they must be discreet and blend into the crowd.</p>\n<p>Debbie: That's a cool outfit, isn't it?<br>\nJennifer: Well, it passes, but you know, we're not here to be fashionable, we're just here to have local outfits.<br>\nDebbie: I know, well, there's that.<br>\nJennifer: Yeah, that's good. Come on, we'll take that.</p>\n<p>Debbie and Jennifer finish their shopping and return to the building Julius bought.</p>\n<p>Russell: Actually, Julius, are you sure nobody's gonna follow us? Since you bought the building, your name must be somewhere?<br>\nJulius : I took my precautions at the position I held at GenCorp, I had the opportunity to make purchases without my name could not be found.<br>\nRussell: Good, that makes me feel better. Otherwise how much did you take at GenCorp?<br>\nJulius: That number, I keep it to myself, sorry, Russell.<br>\nRussell: Hm, no problem, you're in charge anyway.</p>\n<p>Debbie and Jennifer finally arrive, Cedric and Albert will help them clean everything up. Luke remains relatively distant and seems to be watching Julius' actions. Julius was up to something, but the question was, what.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-11-the-drumel-genes",chapitreApres:"chapter-13-escape-for-freedom",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-2",slug:"chapter-12-theft",codeChapitre:"H0002C012",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-12-vol"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-12-theft"}}}});
