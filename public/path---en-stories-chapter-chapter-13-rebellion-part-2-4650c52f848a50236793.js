Éléa decides to park a street away, Clara parks behind her. Éléa gets out of her car. I also go out and look at Clara who comes out smiling at us.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Do you want to go? You know there are armed men in there?<br>\nClara: I don't want to sit here and do nothing.<br>\nElea: She can distract the guards at the entrance. That would give us time to get in through the service door, the guards will be too busy with Clara to watch the cameras.<br>\nWamien: Okay. All right.<br>\nClara: So I distract the guards from the entrance. I'm gonna say I'm lost.<br>\nWamien: Good idea.<br>\nÉléa: Yeah, the guards will be too nice to refuse to help you.<br>\nClara: Perfect. Shall we go?<br>\nWamien: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Éléa becomes invisible. Clara looks at her with big eyes.</p>\n<p>Clara: Wow, that's cool.<br>\nÉléa: Yeah, follow me.</p>\n<p>The three of us go to the lab, once we get close to the doors, Clara comes in and Éléa takes my hand to take me to the service door she was talking about. We wait a little, two minutes big maximum and we go in. No alarms sound.</p>\n<p>Éléa: Fine, stay on your guard.</p>\n<p>At the same time, two guards turn the corner of the corridor.</p>\n<p>A guard: Hey you! What are you doing here!</p>\n<p>He pulls out his gun and points it at me. The second makes the same gesture and they approach.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Darakei would be mad if you hurt me, you know?<br>\nLeft guard: Yeah, that's why they're electric bullets.</p>\n<p>The heads of the two guards bump into each other, producing the shock sound of two coconuts. They fall to the ground and both weapons are taken.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Thank you, Éléa.<br>\nÉléa: You don't know me, come on, take up the weapons to defend yourself. I'll unlock the doors, all you have to do is open them, take it out on the guards, it'll keep them busy.<br>\nWamien: No problem.</p>\n<p>I go towards the cell doors and I cross the road of a guard group.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Yo guys!</p>\n<p>They turn around and I shoot them with electric bullets. They soon fall to the ground in groans of pain. I hear another group coming and I start running to escape them. \"Better take them by surprise.\" I take my place, ready to hit the first one that passes. Two guys are turning the corner of the hallway. I hit one right in the face, he falls on his ass and gets up quickly. The second one tries to hit me, I block his fist with my forearm and block his arm against the wall to hit him in the stomach and then in the face. I step back a little and kick him in the stomach. The guard steps back and falls. The first guard, who now bleeds from the nose, manages to hit me in the arm. The echo of my metal is heard and the guy holds his wrist clenching his teeth. I can't help but smile, seeing these guys suffer because they support this kind of action is only what they deserve. I take a step back and hit him with the palm of my hand. Bumping him against a wall.</p>\n<p>I go back a little and run back to the cells, I am not too far, Éléa must already have unlocked the doors and explained to the others how it will happen. Three guards go down the hall, they go to the cells. I hope they haven't spotted them. I'm going down the hall. I pull out my gun and shoot the three guards in the back. I hear guards screaming behind me, I turn around and I hear the shots being fired. \"I must stop them.\" My body instinctively positions itself, my hands position themselves in the direction of the guards and the bullets stop and are diverted to finish their race in the walls. I stay like that and focus on weapons that deconstruct themselves into a pile of individual pieces. The lights flicker and go out. I run towards them, seeing very well in the dark and the gards fall like rocks after a few blows.</p>\n<p>I resume my race and finally arrive at the cells.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Come out and follow me, folks!<br>\nTiana: Wamien! Great!<br>\nSam: Wamien!</p>\n<p>I'm looking into Tom's empty cell.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Tom's not here?<br>\nSam: He's... dead...<br>\nWamien: No, that's not true.<br>\nSam: I'll explain once we're out, please destroy my chains.</p>\n<p>I'm destroying his ties. It spreads its wings, it's majestic. The three of us will take out the other subjects, reading the names, so we can name them.</p>\n<p>Éléa: We have to go back and really fast.<br>\nTiana: Who just spoke?<br>\nWamien: Éléa, she's invisible, she's a friend, come on, follow me!</p>\n<p>We all go together to one of the emergency exits, the alarm sounding all over the complex. We're dealing with a group of guards. Tim, taller and wider than me, takes the lead while Alexis removes the weapons from the guards by levitating them over their heads. Tim puts them on the wall without difficulty, knocking them out one after the other. Alexis brings the weapons back to us and we move forward with this method. Tim kicks in a door that was locked for security and we finally get out. Éléa takes the lead and leaves with the others, I destroy the cameras and close the door, making the metal of the door intertwine, making it absolutely impossible to open. I join the others who are settling in the car, Clara was waiting by the cars.</p>\n<p>We leave the kingdom without problem, Éléa having a special access, not need to pay a penny to pass. Clara then takes the lead and we drive a good hour to get to the country house, far from everything.</p>\n<p>Éléa: Wamien, I'm going to have to leave again, okay?<br>\nWamien: Don't worry, thank you so much.</p>\n<p>She smiles and comes to give me a kiss on the cheek.</p>\n<p>Éléa: We don't know each other, okay?<br>\nWamien: All right, let's get everybody out of the car.</p>\n<p>Everybody out and we go inside the house.</p>\n<p>Clara: There's enough room for everyone.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-13-rebellion-part-1",chapitreApres:"chapter-14-presentations",nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-1",slug:"chapter-13-rebellion-part-2",codeChapitre:"H0001C014",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-13-la-rebellion-partie-2"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-13-rebellion-part-2"}}}});
