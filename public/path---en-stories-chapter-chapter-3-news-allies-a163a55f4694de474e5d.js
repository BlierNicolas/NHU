I had heard everything because of the thin walls and that my parents are unable to speak in a low voice. I open my bedroom door and go to the door. My parents stay away from me and threaten me.</p>\n<p>My father: Give us back our son!<br>\nMy mother: Give it back, you monster!<br>\nKellan: You really are shit parents, I hope Ophelia gets through this.</p>\n<p>My mother was going to say something, but I just don't know. I open the door and get out. I can hear the sirens of approaching police cars. I go in the opposite direction and start running. I feel the ground falling under my feet. I try to put less force into it so they can't follow me. After a while, I managed to get out of town. Several people saw me, finally, they saw a giant running. I know people have been filming me.</p>\n<p>The cars honk at me when I see them, I put both feet on the ground and propel me several meters into the air. I can't hold back a laugh. I begin to descend to the ground, both feet down, ready to receive myself. I land and raise a cloud of dust. I start again, I know there's a big forest where I could hide for a while. I jump up and down until I get to the forest. I'm going in. I have the impression that the forests will be my friends for a few days, maybe even longer.</p>\n<p>Two days pass, I managed to find some fruit, but it's barely enough to fill my stomach. I decide to go out after dark and I go to a nearby town. No way I'm going back to my hometown, it's clear they're still looking for me. After a good hour of jumping, I arrive near the city, I arrive from a less wealthy neighbourhood, but perhaps I would find something to cover myself. I walk by the alleyways and see if anyone would have left sheets or anything like that lying around. I find a big black sheet floating in the wind. I steal it unscrupulously and pass it around. I tie two corners together, it looks like I have a cape, but it's only to protect me from the cold. I continue on my way in search of a butcher shop or a business in the kind where there would be enough meat to fill my stomach and give me back my strength.</p>\n<p>After an hour of searching, I find a small business. I open the door and hear an alarm system go off. I find the device in question and tear it off the wall, the alarm goes off. I smile a little, if I'd known it was that easy to turn off an alarm. I start to cross the shelves and start eating what I find, sweets, snacks, fruits that were on the shelves. Anyway, I was able to enjoy a good feast. I come out of the store with reserves, enough to last a few days.</p>\n<p>I spend my time hiding and moving from warehouse to warehouse. I am able to accumulate food and clothing fairly quickly, but the police are starting to watch more and more. I can use my strength and control myself better.</p>\n<p>I've been wandering around the city for months, I have a few places where I've hidden resources. I walk around at night and avoid bright places, but for the last few days I feel like I am being followed. So I try to lose the person by hiding in an alley. The silhouette passes in front of me, I come out of my hiding place at the last moment and try to put the person against the wall, but suddenly, nobody.</p>\n<p>Kellan: Huh? But there was someone.<br>\nDude: You're too slow, fat boy.</p>\n<p>I look around, there was a guy sitting on a dumpster. I look at him and I put myself on my guard.</p>\n<p>Kellan: Who are you?<br>\nDrake: I'm Drake, and I'd look for a big guy like you.<br>\nKellan: To do what?<br>\nDrake: I'm putting together a team for a project.<br>\nKellan: Okay, get out of my sight and stop following me or I'll blow your head against a wall.<br>\nDrake: I'm too fast for you.</p>\n<p>I go towards the exit of the alley and then in an instant, it is in front of me. I step back and look at him with big eyes.</p>\n<p>Drake: So? This project?<br>\nKellan: So what is this project?<br>\nDrake: We're going to be the richest people.<br>\nKellan: How? You a guy who works for big companies or something?<br>\nDrake: Nope, we'll just rob banks and kill people if we have to.<br>\nKellan: How many members does your team have?<br>\nDrake: Oh, three members if we're counting you.<br>\nKellan: Oh, well, you'll contact me when you have a bigger team.<br>\nDrake: I can provide you with a roof, clothes your size and food, including cooked meat.<br>\nKellan: So you were really following me.<br>\nDrake: Let's just say you notice a guy with a power like yours.<br>\nKellan: A power?<br>\nDrake: Yeah, you're super strong, aren't you?<br>\nKellan: Yes, but I control myself better now, before I broke everything.<br>\nDrake: It's the same for me, except my power is hyper speed.<br>\nKellan: Nice.<br>\nDrake: Come on, follow me, I'll take you up to my house.<br>\nKellan: Okay, I'll follow you.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-2-attack-in-the-park",chapitreApres:null,nomRoman:"the-black-eagles-mastodon",slug:"chapter-3-news-allies",codeChapitre:"H0009C003",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-3-nouveaux-allies"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-3-news-allies"}}}});
