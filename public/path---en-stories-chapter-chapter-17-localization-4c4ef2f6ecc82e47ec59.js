It is clear that the public knows when messages will surface and therefore when to avoid them. Bailey, Kameron and I pass the relays to watch when the messages stop. I was sitting on the couch looking on the network maps where this damn group can send their damn message from. The number of possible sites is about 20 and the teams of Darakei have already searched several places without speaking of the forces of authority which prevent us from entering either Dontol, Hutlia and Giotry. It is clear that the possible location would be in Giotry's country, but simply asking for the right of way can rekindle the flame of conflict between Giotry and Albaltia. I almost hesitate to go with a team and cross customs as a simple civilian, but Clara doesn't want me to risk making this crossing. I sigh and hit the table with my fist.</p>\n<p>Wamien: There must be a solution!</p>\n<p>I hear Clara startle.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Sorry Clara...<br>\nClara: It's okay, it's nothing.</p>\n<p>She comes up and sits next to me. I look at her with my eyes full of fatigue and exasperation. Clara smiles gently at me and puts her hand through my hair.</p>\n<p>Clara: You'll figure it out, as usual.<br>\nWamien: Thank you, beautiful.</p>\n<p>Clara gives me her famous smile that would melt the hearts of all men. I smile a little and rest my gaze on the map. I put my hand over my chin while I think. Clara looks at the map too.</p>\n<p>Clara: If you go to Giotry and something happens to you, I'll be very angry.<br>\nWamien: Nothing will happen to me, I promise.<br>\nClara: I hope so. You have my approval to go.<br>\nWamien: Seriously?<br>\nClara: Yes.</p>\n<p>We look at each other, she takes my hand.</p>\n<p>Clara: But when you get back, I expect you to bring me a souvenir.</p>\n<p>I kiss her gently and then put my forehead against hers.</p>\n<p>Wamien: I promise you.</p>\n<p>I got up and sent a message to the team members who had agreed to come with me to Giotry in the first place. It was going to be a challenge to find them and notify the authorities. So we are about ten people at Hiro's place, planning plans, separating places to look and prepare disguises to avoid being recognized once we are inside the country. We're gonna have 12 places to check if we find any clues on their possible lair. In the event that something was found, it was established that it was leaving the scene and that the other groups were being notified. We turn them over to the authorities and leave the country. It will be their responsibility to manage those peoples. But as soon as they get out of the country, they'll be at our mercy.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Did everyone understand the plan?<br>\nEverybody: Yeah!<br>\nWamien: Then let's go.</p>\n<p>We'll all get up and change into our clothes. The first ones who are ready go to the cars that Elea had us deliver. Everyone's ready pretty quickly. We'll get in the cars and head for Giotry. </p>\n<p>After a few hours on the road, a few stops and bad jokes from Alexis, we finally arrive at Giotry border. I lower my window, stop the engine and remove the keys from the ignition.</p>\n<p>Customs officer: Passports and 20 dollars per head.</p>\n<p>The customs officer seems to have noticed the small gestures I made when I arrived, I handed him everyone's electronic passports as well as the money corresponding to the cost of passage of the whole group.</p>\n<p>Wamien: The back car is with us too.<br>\nCustoms officer: Okay, is that a one-way or a round trip?<br>\nWamien: Round trip, we have a business trip that would last three days.<br>\nCustoms officer: Um, all right, which hotel? Can I get a receipt?</p>\n<p>I hand him the hotel receipts with a gentle smile. He turns to his computer to perform the checks. Everyone waited wisely and in silence. He takes turns naming our false identities. I declare if the individual is in our car or the one behind.</p>\n<p>Customs officer: All right, I'd ask you to go ahead and park there. A customs officer will come to give you your passports after checking with your friends.</p>\n<p>He points us to a parking lot for checks.</p>\n<p>Wamien: All right, thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>I'll put the ignition back on and park. I'm watching how it's going with the other car. He sees that everyone is there and they come to park next to us right after. Another customs officer comes out of the cabin and walks towards us. He's here to return my passports and hotel receipts.</p>\n<p>The customs officer returns to his cabin. We're going to the nearest place to check. We arrive quickly in the city and we separate the groups to cover more ground. My group and I arrive near the first place, a building in very bad condition, but inhabited by several families.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Kameron, watch the surroundings with Thalie, I will connect to the network and try to identify where the energy consumption is higher.</p>\n<p>I put my hand on the circuit breaker and close my eyes, without difficulty, I enter the system of the building. On the 8th floor, more than a hundred devices located. I continue to search and I managed to find a webcam, directly I see a man in his thirties, glasses, long hair, clearly a problem of overweight. No connections with any member of the Black Eagles or the Legion, but location. I take my hand off and look at my teammates.</p>\n<p>Wamien: Wrong place, we go to the next one.<br>\nKameron: Dac, chief!</p>\n<p>So we're off to location number two. We continue on this path, I receive a message from the other two teams after each check. We're at the end of the list and so are the other two teams. I send a message to the other teams explaining that we will check the last places and we will meet at the hotel afterwards, whether we find the location or not. Sam and Alexis are validating my orders.</p>\n<p>As I drive to the hotel, we get a message from Alexis' team. He thinks he found their location, but he's not 100 percent sure.</p>\n<p>Wamien: What makes you doubt?<br>\nAlexis: Some civilians say they've seen strange people walking around this area. There are several electronic installations and also, the place is big enough to shelter those that one seeks.<br>\nWamien: And what makes you doubt their location?<br>\nAlexis: The place will be destroyed in two days. They want to build a residential building on this site.<br>\nWamien: I admit it's odd. Go back to the hotel, we can rest and leave tomorrow.<br>\nAlexis: Perfect boss.</p>\n<p>I can't hold back a smile, I have a good feeling now. Maybe we found their hiding place. Half an hour later, Alexis' team arrives. All the necessary information is exchanged and I send everything to the country's peace officers, as well as to Darakei to inform him.</p>"}},chapitreAvant:"chapter-16-get-tatooed",chapitreApres:null,nomRoman:"the-first-cyborg-volume-2",slug:"chapter-17-localization",codeChapitre:"H0002C017",equivalentUrl:"/histoires/chapitre/chapitre-17-localisation"}},pathContext:{slug:"chapter-17-localization"}}}});
