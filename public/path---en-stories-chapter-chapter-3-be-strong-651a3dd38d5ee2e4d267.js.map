The lady turned to leave the room and headed to the right. I follow her to avoid getting lost in the maze of corridors and rooms and especially to avoid trouble.</p>\\n<p>I follow the lady and look around me, relatively intimidated by the look of the scientists present. I'm focusing on following the lady.

I enter the dark room and as I turn around, the doors close behind me.</p>\\n<p>Tim: Hey! Don't lock me in there!</p>\\n<p>I run to the door and clench my fist, the sleeve of my sweater tears under the difference in the size of my arm. I move my arm back to knock and give a powerful punch on the door. The metal got a little deformed, but it would take me hundreds of hits to make a hole in the door. The impact still resonates in the room, I turn around and some lights come on.</p>\\n<p>I pleat my eyes out of reflex and to get used to the light, I notice some kind of metal mannequins. Maybe I should break them? I look around, see if I can see anything else. I clench my fists and my arms get bigger, as do my torso and legs. I run to the metal mannequins and bust the first one with a punch. I jump on the second and crush it with my feet. I look around me and weights come out of the ground.</p>\\n<p>Scientific: All right, now we'll measure your strength. Start with the 100 pound one.</p>\\n<p>I approach the weight indicated by the scientist and lift it without problems.</p>\\n<p>Scientific: Oh, lift the one next to it and keep lifting heavier weights.</p>\\n<p>I put the weight of 100 pounds and go to the next, 250 pounds according to what is written on the cast iron. I lift it without problem, even if it is heavier than the 100 pounds. I'll put it down and move on to the next one. I continue like this and lift the weight of a ton, I manage to lift it to the level of my hips, but I let it go.</p>\\n<p>Scientific: Okay, we'll stop there. No need to go to the next one.<br>\\nTim: I'll try anyway!<br>\\nScientist: One ton is already a huge feat, Tim.</p>\\n<p>I go to the next weight and take it with both hands. I start to lift it and my arms get a little bigger. I manage to lift it up to my shoulders and shake a little. I clench my teeth and push the weight a little further away from me. I look at the door and start running towards the door and charge. I bang on the door and walk back a few steps.</p>\\n<p>Tim: Ouch... could you open the door now?<br>\\nScientist: You still have two more exams to take.<br>\\nTim: So! What are you waiting for?!

I start to run after taking an inspiration. I am going faster and faster and finish quickly the 100 meters to go. I get to the end of the track and start slowing down. I place my left foot forward and turn it to the side to slow down and finally stop.</p>\\n<p>Tim: So! That's good!?<br>\\nScientific: Perfect, finally, the endurance race, you have to do 50 laps of tracks as fast as possible.</p>\\n<p>I go to the start of the race track and start running, I want to get rid of this. I make the 50 turns quickly, I place myself in direction of the door and begin to load.</p>\\n<p>Scientist: Don't do this Tim! Stop it! Stop it!<br>\\nTim: Shut up!</p>\\n<p>The door opens a little before the impact, I try to slow down and rush into the wall. I fall on the other side of the wall.
