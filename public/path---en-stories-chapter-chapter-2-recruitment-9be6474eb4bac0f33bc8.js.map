Alicia Natir, Carlos Hennors and Sébastien Dalam, all three of the same age, 17. They all went to the same school according to their records. I couldn't improvise a visit without getting in trouble. I'll have to try to contact them online or in person. I risk trying to get in touch with them on social networking sites. We'll see what happens. I sent a message to Darakei to tell him what was happening on my side. Darakei replied that he was happy that I was able to find new humans. I told him that I would continue to look, in addition to starting to investigate criminal groups across the country.</p>\\n<p>I browse news sites and look at everything that has to do with criminal activity. I chose my new country of residence well. The crime rate has increased by 500% over the past 10 years. Already in my city, there are two criminal groups that are growing and many more in other major cities of the country. I'm surprised the public doesn't complain so much, probably because the police are corrupt.</p>\\n<p>I wonder what I could do against them and how I could do it without getting killed. I was gonna need backup.</p>\\n<p>So I'm going out to dinner, lunch and work.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Alicia came into her class and was talking with her friend Cath. They laughed well together. They pass by Carlos who looks at them briefly before refocusing on his reading. The class filled up faster and faster with the class that was about to start. Sébastien comes in and sits down, he was the kind of guy all the girls were watching. He usually greeted everyone, but this time he seemed lost in thought. The reason was known to him alone, he had just woken up and was floating a meter above his bed. The class finally started and the teacher gave his class, the class was in absolute silence.</p>\\n<p>At the end of class Alicia was looking at her phone, who was Daryl and what did he want with her? It simply ignores it. Sébastien also looked at his phone, he accepts the request without paying too much attention. </p>\\n<p>Carlos had gone to the bathroom, he locked himself in a cabin before looking at his hands, he was shaking. Carlos is trying to catch his breath and calm down. He looks at the wooden wall of the cabin and puts one hand on it, immediately his hand takes the texture of the wood, the texture rises quietly along his arm and he removes it from the wall before it reaches his elbow. The texture gradually resumes that of Carlos' skin.</p>\\n<p>Carlos: What is this shit...</p>\\n<p>He takes out his phone and sees the notification, why would a random guy want to add him? It goes on its photo application and puts on recording. He frames his hand and rests it on the wall, the same phenomenon occurs. Carlos drops the wall and stops recording, it takes him a few tries as his finger was still made of wood.</p>\\n<p>Sébastien receives a message from Daryl, he asked him to be alone before reading the rest of the message.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Once you're alone, continue reading this message...</p>\\n<p>I hope I don't contact you too soon, but you will experience or already experience a strange phenomenon.

Also, I'd like to know if you're in contact with Alicia Natir and Carlos Hennors.</p>\\n<p>Thank you and good day, Daryl.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The first question Sébastien asks himself is, how did he know about his power. Then he realizes that maybe Alicia and Carlos also have a power.

Alicia had not yet had any manifestations of her power.</p>\\n<p>Cath: So? What are you doing tonight?<br>\\nAlicia: I don't know yet, probably stay home and watch a movie.<br>\\nCath: Oh! Can I come too? Please~<br>\\nAlicia: Hm, yeah, why not~ But you stay at my place, you're not going out at night.<br>\\nCath: I know, in the worst case, I would take a taxi.</p>\\n<p>The two young women continued to talk and walked to their next class.</p>\\n<p>Carlos was coming out of the bathroom, Sébastien sees him and approaches.</p>\\n<p>Sébastien: Yo, um, Carlos, right?</p>\\n<p>Carlos looks at Sébastien, he had his usual depressed look, not the kind of guy to smile for nothing.</p>\\n<p>Carlos: What do you want?<br>\\nSébastien: I want to know something actually, did some Daryl contact you?<br>\\nCarlos: Why? Is this one of your buddies trying to play a bad joke on me?<br>\\nSébastien: Not at all, it's actually a very serious question.<br>\\nCarlos: Well, yeah, I got a request from that guy, why?<br>\\nSébastien: Did you read his message?<br>\\nCarlos: No. I didn't even get a message.<br>\\nSébastien: Accept his request, he'll send you one.<br>\\nCarlos: We'll see, I have to go to class.</p>\\n<p>Carlos leaves for his locker, Sébastien stays there watching him go, he wasn't sure if Carlos was going to do it.
